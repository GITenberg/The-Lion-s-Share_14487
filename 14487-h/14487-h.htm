<h3>MISS INGATE, AND THE YACHT</h3>


<p>Audrey had just closed the safe in her father&#8217;s study when
she was startled by a slight noise. She turned like a
defensive animal to face danger. It had indeed occurred
to her that she was rather like an animal in captivity, and
she found a bitter pleasure in the idea, though it was not
at all original.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Flank Hall is my Zoo!&#8221; she had said. (Not
that she had ever seen the Zoological Gardens or visited
London.)</p>

<p>She was lithe; she moved with charm. Her short, plain
blue serge walking-frock disclosed the form of her limbs
and left them free, and it made her look younger even
than she was. Its simplicity suited her gestures and took
grace from them. But she wore the old thing without the
least interest in it&mdash;almost unconsciously. She had none of
the preoccupations caused by the paraphernalia of existence.
She scarcely knew what it was to own. She was aware only
of her body and her soul. Beyond these her possessions
were so few, so mean, so unimportant, that she might have
carried them to the grave and into heaven without protest
from the authorities earthly or celestial.</p>

<p>The slight noise was due to the door of the study,
which great age had distorted and bereft of sense, and, in
fact, almost unhinged. It unlatched itself, paused, and
then calmly but firmly swung wide open. When it could
swing no farther it shook, vibrating into repose.</p>

<p>Audrey condemned the door for a senile lunatic, and
herself for a poltroon. She became defiant of peril, until
the sound of a step on the stair beyond the door threw
her back into alarm. But when the figure of Miss Ingate
appeared in the doorway she was definitely reassured, to
the point of disdain. All her facial expression said: &#8220;It&#8217;s
only Miss Ingate.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet Miss Ingate was not a negligible woman. Her
untidy hair was greying; she was stout, she was fifty, she
was plain, she had not elegance; her accent and turns of
speech were noticeably those of Essex. But she had a
magnificent pale forehead; the eyes beneath it sparkled
with energy, inquisitiveness, and sagacity; and the mouth
beneath the eyes showed by its sardonic dropping corners
that she had come to a settled, cheerful conclusion about
human nature, and that the conclusion was not flattering.
Miss Ingate was a Guardian of the Poor, and the Local
Representative of the Soldiers&#8217; and Sailors&#8217; Families Association.
She had studied intimately the needy and the rich
and the middling. She was charitable without illusions;
and, while adhering to every social convention, she did so
with a toleration pleasantly contemptuous; in her heart she
had no mercy for snobs of any kind, though, unfortunately,
she was at times absurdly intimidated by them&mdash;at other
times she was not.</p>

<p>To the west, within a radius of twelve miles, she knew
everybody and everybody knew her; to the east her fame
was bounded only by the regardless sea. She and her
ancestors had lived in the village of Moze as long as even
Mr. Mathew Moze and his ancestors. In the village, and
to the village, she was Miss Ingate, a natural phenomenon,
like the lie of the land and the river Moze. Her opinions
offended nobody, not Mr. Moze himself&mdash;she was Miss
Ingate. She was laughed at, beloved and respected. Her
sagacity had one flaw, and the flaw sprang from her sincere
conviction that human nature in that corner of Essex,
which she understood so profoundly, and where she was
so perfectly at home, was different from, and more fondly
foolish than, human nature in any other part of the world.
She could not believe that distant populations could be
at once so pathetically and so naughtily human as the
population in and around Moze.</p>

<p>If Audrey disdained Miss Ingate, it was only because
Miss Ingate was neither young nor fair nor the proprietress
of some man, and because people made out that she was
peculiar. In some respects Audrey looked upon Miss
Ingate as a life-belt, as the speck of light at the end of a
tunnel, as the enigmatic smile which glimmers always in
the frown of destiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; cried Miss Ingate in her rather shrill voice,
grinning sardonically, with the corners of her lips still lower
than usual in anticipatory sarcasm. It was as if she had
said: &#8220;You cannot surprise me by any narrative of imbecility
or turpitude or bathos. All the same, I am dying
to hear the latest eccentricity of this village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; parried Audrey, holding one hand behind her.</p>

<p>They did not shake hands. People who call at ten
o&#8217;clock in the morning cannot expect to have their hands
shaken. Miss Ingate certainly expected nothing of the
sort. She had the freedom of Flank Hall, as of scores
of other houses, at all times of day. Servants opened front
doors for her with a careless smile, and having shut
front doors they left her loose, like a familiar cat, to find
what she wanted. They seldom &#8220;showed&#8221; her into any
room, nor did they dream of acting before her the unconvincing
comedy of going to &#8220;see&#8221; whether masters or
mistresses were out or in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your mother?&#8221; asked Miss Ingate idly, quite
sure that interesting divulgations would come, and quite
content to wait for them. She had been out of the village
for over a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s taking her acetyl salicylic,&#8221; Audrey answered,
coming to the door of the study.</p>

<p>This meant merely that Mrs. Moze had a customary
attack of the neuralgia for which the district is justly
renowned among strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; murmured Miss Ingate callously. Mrs. Moze,
though she had lived in the district for twenty-five years,
did not belong to it. If she chose to keep on having
neuralgia, that was her affair, but in justice to natives
and to the district she ought not to make too much of it,
and she ought to admit that it might well be due to her
weakness after her operation. Miss Ingate considered the
climate to be the finest in England; which it was, on the
condition that you were proof against neuralgia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s gone to Colchester in the car to see the
Bishop,&#8221; Audrey coldly added.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known he was going to Colchester I should
have asked him for a lift,&#8221; said Miss Ingate, with
determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! He&#8217;d have taken <em>you!</em>&#8220; said Audrey, reserved.
&#8220;I suppose you had fine times in London!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! It was vehy exciting! It was vehy exciting!&#8221;
Miss Ingate agreed loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father wouldn&#8217;t let me read about it in the paper,&#8221;
said Audrey, still reserved. &#8220;He never will, you know.
But I did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! But you didn&#8217;t read about me playing the barrel
organ all the way down Regent Street, because that wasn&#8217;t
in any of the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <em>didn&#8217;t!</em>&#8220; Audrey protested, with a sudden dark
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. And vehy tiring
it was. Vehy tiring indeed. It&#8217;s quite an art to turn a
barrel organ. If you don&#8217;t keep going perfectly even it
makes the tune jerky. Oh! I know a bit about barrel
organs now. They smashed it all to pieces. Oh yes! All
to pieces. I spoke to the police. I said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you going
to protect these ladies&#8217; property?&#8217; But they didn&#8217;t lift a
finger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And weren&#8217;t you arrested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; shrieked Miss Ingate. &#8220;Me arrested!&#8221; Then
more quietly, in an assured tone, &#8220;Oh no! I wasn&#8217;t
arrested. You see, as soon as the row began I just walked
away from the organ and became one of the crowd. I&#8217;m all
<em>for</em> them, but I wasn&#8217;t going to be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate&#8217;s sparkling eyes seemed to say: &#8220;Sylvia
Pankhurst can be arrested if she likes, and so can Mrs.
Despard and Annie Kenney and Jane Foley, or any of them.
But the policeman that is clever enough to catch Miss
Ingate of Moze does not exist. And the gumption of Miss
Ingate of Moze surpasses the united gumption of all the
other feminists in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!&#8221; repeated Miss Ingate with
mingled complacency, glee, passion, and sardonic tolerance
of the whole panorama of worldly existence. &#8220;The police
were awful, shocking. But I was not arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <em>I</em> was&mdash;this morning,&#8221; said Audrey in a low and
poignant voice.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate was startled out of her mood of the detached
ironic spectator.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she frowned.</p>

<p>They heard a servant moving about at the foot of the
stairs, and a capped head could be seen through the
interstices of the white Chinese balustrade. The study was
the only immediate refuge; Miss Ingate advanced right into
it, and Audrey pushed the door to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s given me a month&#8217;s C.B.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate, gazing at the girl&#8217;s face, saw in its quiet
and yet savage desperation the possibility that after all she
might indeed be surprised by the vagaries of human nature
in the village. And her glance became sympathetic, even
tender, as well as apprehensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;C.B.&#8217;? What do you mean&mdash;&#8216;C.B.&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what C.B. means?&#8221; exclaimed Audrey
with scornful superiority over the old spinster. &#8220;Confined to
barracks. Father says I&#8217;m not to go beyond the grounds for
a month. And to-day&#8217;s the second of April!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he does. He&#8217;s given me a week, you know, before.
Now it&#8217;s a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate looked round at the shabby study, with its
guns, cigar-boxes, prints, books neither old nor new,
japanned boxes of documents, and general litter scattered
over the voluted walnut furniture. Her own house was old-fashioned,
and she realised it was old-fashioned; but
when she came into Flank Hall, and particularly into Mr.
Moze&#8217;s study, she felt as if she was stepping backwards
into history&mdash;and this in spite of the fact that nothing
in the place was really ancient, save the ceilings and the
woodwork round the windows. It was Mr. Moze&#8217;s habit of
mind that dominated and transmogrified the whole interior,
giving it the quality of a mausoleum. The suffragette procession
in which Miss Ingate had musically and discreetly
taken part seemed to her as she stood in Mr. Moze&#8217;s changeless
lair to be a phantasm. Then she looked at the young
captive animal and perceived that two centuries may coincide
on the same carpet and that time is merely a convention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you been doing?&#8221; she questioned, with delicacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took a strange man by the hand,&#8221; said Audrey,
choosing her words queerly, as she sometimes did, to produce
a dramatic effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Eight o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Is there a strange man in the village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you haven&#8217;t seen the yacht!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yacht?&#8221; Miss Ingate showed some excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and look, Winnie,&#8221; said Audrey, who occasionally
thought fit to address Miss Ingate in the manner of the
elder generation. She drew Miss Ingate to the window.</p>

<p>Between the brown curtains Mozewater, the broad,
shallow estuary of the Moze, was spread out glittering in
the sunshine which could not get into the chilly room. The
tide was nearly at full, and the estuary looked like a mighty
harbour for great ships; but in six hours it would be
reduced to a narrow stream winding through mud flats of
marvellous ochres, greens, and pinks. In the hazy distance
a fitful white flash showed where ocean waves were breaking
on a sand-bank. And in the foreground, against a disused
Hard that was a couple of hundred yards lower down than
the village Hard, a large white yacht was moored, probably
the largest yacht that had ever threaded that ticklish
navigation. She was a shallow-draft barge-yacht, rigged
like a Thames barge, and her whiteness and the glint of her
brass, and the flicker of her ensign at the stern were
dazzling. Blue figures ran busily about on her, and a white-and-blue
person in a peaked cap stood importantly at the
wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was on the mud last night,&#8221; said Audrey eagerly,
&#8220;opposite the Flank buoy, and she came up this morning at
half-flood. I think they made fast at Lousey Hard, because
they couldn&#8217;t get any farther without waiting. They have
a motor, and it must be their first trip this season. I was
on the dyke. I wasn&#8217;t even looking at them, but they called
me, so I had to go. They only wanted to know if Lousey
Hard was private. Of course I told them it wasn&#8217;t. It was
a very middle-aged man spoke to me. He must be the
owner. As soon as they were tied up he wanted to jump
ashore. It was rather awkward, and I just held out my
hand to help him. Father saw me from here. I might have
known he would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! It&#8217;s going off!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>The yacht swung slowly round, held by her stern to the
Hard. Then the last hawser was cast off, and she floated
away on the first of the ebb; and as she moved, her main-sail,
unbrailed, spread itself out and became a vast pinion.
Like a dream of happiness she lessened and faded, and
Lousey Hard was as lonely and forlorn as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you explain to your father?&#8221; Miss Ingate
demanded of Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did. But he wouldn&#8217;t listen. He never
does. I might just as well have explained to the hall-clock.
He raged. I think he enjoys losing his temper. He said I
oughtn&#8217;t to have been there at all, and it was just like me,
and he couldn&#8217;t understand it in a daughter of his, and it
would be a great shock to my poor mother, and he&#8217;d talked
enough&mdash;he should now proceed to action. All the usual
things. He actually asked me who &#8216;the man&#8217; was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell? For goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t go imitating
father, Winnie! ... Rather a dull man, I should say.
Rather like father, only not so old. He had a beautiful
necktie; I think it must have been made out of a strip of
Joseph&#8217;s coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate giggled at a high pitch, and Audrey responsively
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear! Oh dear!&#8221; murmured Miss Ingate when her
giggling was exhausted. &#8220;How queer it is that a girl like
you can&#8217;t keep your father in a good temper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father hates me to say funny things. If I say anything
funny he turns as black as ink&mdash;and he takes care to
keep gloomy all the rest of the day, too. He never laughs.
Mother laughs now and then, but I never heard father laugh.
Oh yes, I did. He laughed when the cat fell out of the bathroom
window on to the lawn-roller. He went quite red in
the face with laughing.... I say, Miss Ingate, do you
think father&#8217;s mad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think he&#8217;s what you call mad,&#8221; replied Miss
Ingate judicially, with admirable sang-froid. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
so many peculiar people in my time. And you must remember,
Audrey, this is a peculiar part of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I believe he&#8217;s mad, anyway. I believe he&#8217;s got
men on the brain, especially young men. He&#8217;s growing
worse. Yesterday he told me I musn&#8217;t have the punt out on
Mozewater this season unless he&#8217;s with me. Fancy skiffing
about with father! He says I&#8217;m too old for that now. So
there you are. The older I get the less I&#8217;m allowed to do.
I can&#8217;t go a walk, unless it&#8217;s an errand. The pedal is off
my bike, and father is much too cunning to have it repaired.
I can&#8217;t boat. I&#8217;m never given any money. He grumbles
frightfully if I want any clothes, so I never want any.
That&#8217;s my latest dodge. I&#8217;ve read every book in the house
except the silly liturgical and legal things he&#8217;s always
having from the London Library&mdash;and I&#8217;ve read even some
of those. He won&#8217;t buy any new music. Golf! Ye gods,
Winnie, you should hear him talk about ladies and golf!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t ruffle me,
because I don&#8217;t play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he plays with girls, and young girls, too, all the
same. He&#8217;s been caught in the act. Ethel told me. He
little thinks I know. He&#8217;d let me play if he could be
the only man on the course. He&#8217;s mad about me and
men. He never looks at me without thinking of all the
boys in the district.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s really very fond of you, Audrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;He ought to keep me in
the china cupboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a great problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s invented a beautiful new trick for keeping me in
when he&#8217;s out. I have to copy his beastly Society letters for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see he&#8217;s got a new box,&#8221; observed Miss Ingate,
glancing into the open cupboard in which stood the safe.
On the top of the safe were two japanned boxes, each
lettered in white: &#8220;The National Reformation Society.&#8221;
The uppermost box was freshly unpacked and shone with all
the intact pride of virginity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should read some of the letters. You really
should, Winnie,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;All the bigwigs of the
Society love writing to each other. I bet you father will
get a typewriting machine this year, and make me learn it.
The chairman has a typewriter, and father means to be the
next chairman. You&#8217;ll see.... Oh! What&#8217;s that?
Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s what?&#8221;</p>

<p>A faint distant throbbing could be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the motor! He&#8217;s coming back for something.
Fly out of here, Winnie, fly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey felt sick at the thought that if her father had
returned only a few minutes earlier he might have trapped
her at the safe itself. She still kept one hand behind her.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate, who with all her qualities was rather easily
flustered, ran out of the dangerous room in Audrey&#8217;s wake.
They met Mr. Mathew Moze at the half-landing of the stairs.</p>

<p>He was a man of average size, somewhat past sixty
years. He had plump cheeks, tinged with red; his hair,
moustache and short, full beard, were quite grey. He wore
a thick wide-spreading ulster, and between his coat and
waistcoat a leather vest, and on his head a grey cap. Put
him in the Strand in town clothes, and he might have been
taken for a clerk, a civil servant, a club secretary, a retired
military officer, a poet, an undertaker&mdash;for anything except
the last of a long line of immovable squires who could not
possibly conceive what it was not to be the owner of land.
His face was preoccupied and overcast, but as soon as he
realised that Miss Ingate was on the stairs it instantly
brightened into a warm and rather wistful smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Miss Ingate,&#8221; he greeted her with
deferential cordiality. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, good morning, Mr. Moze,&#8221; responded
Miss Ingate. &#8220;Vehy nice of you. Vehy nice of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody would have guessed from their demeanour that
they differed on every subject except their loyalty to that
particular corner of Essex, that he regarded her and her
political associates as deadly microbes in the national
organism, and that she regarded him as a nincompoop
crossed with a tyrant. Each of them had a magic glass to
see in the other nothing but a local Effendi and familiar
guardian angel of Moze. Moreover, Mr. Moze&#8217;s public
smile and public manner were irresistible&mdash;until he lost his
temper. He might have had friends by the score, had it
not been for his deep constitutional reserve&mdash;due partly to
diffidence and partly to an immense hidden conceit. Mr.
Moze&#8217;s existence was actuated, though he knew it not, by
the conviction that the historic traditions of England were
committed to his keeping. Hence the conceit, which was
that of a soul secretly self-dedicated.</p>

<p>Audrey, outraged by the hateful hypocrisy of persons
over fifty, and terribly constrained and alarmed, turned
vaguely back up the stairs. Miss Ingate, not quite knowing
what she did, with an equal vagueness followed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in. Do come in,&#8221; urged Mr. Moze at the door
of the study.</p>

<p>Audrey, who remained on the landing, heard her elders
talk smoothly of grave Mozian things, while Mr. Moze
unlocked the new tin box above the safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten a most important paper,&#8221; said he, as
he relocked the box. &#8220;I have an appointment with the
Bishop of Colchester at ten-forty-five, and I fear I may
be late. Will you excuse me, Miss Ingate?&#8221;</p>

<p>She excused him.</p>

<p>Departing, he put the paper into his pocket with a
careful and loving gesture that well symbolised his passionate
affection for the Society of which he was already
the vice-chairman. He had been a member of the National
Reformation Society for eleven years. Despite the promise
of its name, this wealthy association of idealists had no
care for reforms in a sadly imperfect England. Its aim
was anti-Romanist. The Reformation which it had in mind
was Luther&#8217;s, and it wished, by fighting an alleged insidious
revival of Roman Catholicism, to make sure that so far as
England was concerned Luther had not preached in vain.</p>

<p>Mr. Moze&#8217;s connection with the Society had originated
in a quarrel between himself and a Catholic priest from
Ipswich who had instituted a boys&#8217; summer camp on the
banks of Mozewater near the village of Moze. Until that
quarrel, the exceeding noxiousness of the Papal doctrine
had not clearly presented itself to Mr. Moze. In such
strange ways may an ideal come to birth. As Mr. Moze,
preoccupied and gloomy once more, steered himself rapidly
out of Moze towards the episcopal presence, the image of
the imperturbable and Jesuitical priest took shape in his
mind, refreshing his determination to be even with Rome
at any cost.</p>

<h3>THE THIEF&#8217;S PLAN WRECKED</h3>


<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;father has another woman
in the house now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Moze had left Miss Ingate in the study and Audrey
had cautiously rejoined her there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another woman in the house!&#8221; repeated Miss Ingate,
sitting down in happy expectation. &#8220;What on earth do
you mean? Who on earth do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t a woman, Audrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just as much of a woman as you are. All father&#8217;s
behaviour proves it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your father treats you as a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he doesn&#8217;t. He treats me as a woman. If he
thought I was a child he wouldn&#8217;t have anything to worry
about. I&#8217;m over nineteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t. But I could if I liked. I simply
won&#8217;t look it because I don&#8217;t care to be made ridiculous.
I should start to look my age at once if father stopped
treating me like a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve just said he treats you as a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Winnie,&#8221; said the girl sharply.
&#8220;Unless you&#8217;re pretending. Now you&#8217;ve never told me
anything about yourself, and I&#8217;ve always told you lots about
myself. You belong to an old-fashioned family. How
were you treated when you were my age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what way,&#8221; said Audrey, gazing at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear. Things seemed to come very naturally,
somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you ever engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Oh, no!&#8221; answered Miss Ingate with tranquillity.
&#8220;I&#8217;m vehy interested in them. Oh, vehy! Oh,
vehy! And I like talking to them. But anything more
than that gets on my nerves. My eldest sister was the
one. Oh! She was the one. She refused eleven men,
and when she was going to be married she made me
embroider the monograms of all of them on the skirt of her
wedding-dress. She made me, and I had to do it. I sat up
all night the night before the wedding to finish them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did the bridegroom say about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bridegroom didn&#8217;t say anything about it because
he didn&#8217;t know. Nobody knew except Arabella and me.
She just wanted to feel that the monograms were on her
dress, that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How strange!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was. But this is a vehy strange part of the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what happened afterwards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bella died when she had her first baby, and the baby
died as well. And the father&#8217;s dead now, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a horrid story, Winnie!&#8221; Audrey murmured.
And after a pause: &#8220;I like your sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was vehy uncommon. But I liked her too. I
don&#8217;t know why, but I did. She could make the best
marmalade I ever tasted in my born days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could make the best marmalade you ever tasted in
your born days,&#8221; said Audrey, sinking neatly to the floor
and crossing her legs, &#8220;but they won&#8217;t let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t let you! But I thought you did all sorts of
things in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Winnie. I only do one thing. I do as I&#8217;m
told&mdash;and not always even that. Now, if I wanted to
make the best marmalade you ever tasted in your born
days, first of all there would be a fearful row about the
oranges. Secondly, father would tell mother she must tell
me exactly what I was to do. He would also tell cook.
Thirdly and lastly, dear friends, he would come into the
kitchen himself. It wouldn&#8217;t be my marmalade at all. I
should only be a marmalade-making machine. They never
let me have any responsibility&mdash;no, not even when mother&#8217;s
operation was on&mdash;and I&#8217;m never officially free. The kitchen-maid
has far more responsibility than I have. And she
has an evening off and an afternoon off. She can write a
letter without everybody asking her who she&#8217;s writing to.
She&#8217;s only seventeen. She has the morning postman for
a young man now, and probably one or two others that
I don&#8217;t know of. And she has money and she buys her
own clothes. She&#8217;s a very naughty, wicked girl, and I
wish I was in her place. She scorns me, naturally. Who
wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate said not a word. She merely sat with her
hands in the lap of her spotted pale-blue dress, faintly
and sadly smiling.</p>

<p>Audrey burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ingate, what can I do? I must do something.
What can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate shook her head, and put her lips tightly
together, while mechanically smoothing the sides of her
grey coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It beats me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then <em>I&#8217;ll</em> tell you what I can do!&#8221; answered Audrey
firmly, wriggling somewhat nearer to her along the floor.
&#8220;And what I shall do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you promise to keep it a secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate nodded, smiling and showing her teeth.
Her broad polished forehead positively shone with kindly
eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you swear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate hesitated, and then nodded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then put your hand on my head and say, &#8216;I swear.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall leave this house,&#8221; said Audrey in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t, Audrey!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll eat my hand off if I&#8217;ve not left this house by
to-morrow, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; Miss Ingate nearly screamed. &#8220;Now,
Audrey, do reflect. Think what you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey bounded to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what father&#8217;s always saying,&#8221; she exploded
angrily. &#8220;He&#8217;s always telling me to examine myself. The
fact is, I know too much about myself. I know exactly
the kind of girl it is who&#8217;s going to leave this house.
Exactly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey, you frighten me. Where are you going to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s all right then. I am relieved. I thought
perhaps you waited to come to <em>my</em> house. You won&#8217;t
get to London, because you haven&#8217;t any money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have. I&#8217;ve got a hundred pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, you&#8217;ve sworn.... Here!&#8221; she cried
suddenly, and drawing her hand from behind her
back she most sensationally displayed a crushed roll of
bank-notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who did you get those from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get them from anybody. I got them out of
father&#8217;s safe. They&#8217;re his reserve. He keeps them right
at the back of the left-hand drawer, and he&#8217;s so sure
they&#8217;re there that he never looks for them. He thinks
he&#8217;s a perfect model, but really he&#8217;s careless. There&#8217;s a
duplicate key to the safe, you know, and he leaves it
with a lot of other keys loose in his desk. I expect he
thought nobody would ever dream of guessing it was a
key of the safe. I know he never looked at this roll,
because I&#8217;ve been opening the safe every day for weeks
past, and the roll was always the same. In fact, it was
dusty. Then to-day I decided to take it, and here you
are! He finished himself off yesterday, so far as I&#8217;m
concerned, with the business about the punt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you know you&#8217;re a thief, Audrey?&#8221; breathed
Miss Ingate, extremely embarrassed, and for once somewhat
staggered by the vagaries of human nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to forget, Miss Ingate,&#8221; said Audrey
solemnly, &#8220;that Cousin Caroline left me a legacy of two
hundred pounds last year, and that I&#8217;ve never seen a
penny of it. Father absolutely declined to let me have
the tiniest bit of it. Well, I&#8217;ve taken half. He can keep
the other half for his trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate&#8217;s mouth stood open, and her eyes seemed
startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t go to London alone. You wouldn&#8217;t
know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should. I&#8217;ve arranged everything. I shall
wear my best clothes. When I arrive at Liverpool Street
I shall take a taxi. I&#8217;ve got three addresses of boarding-houses
out of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, and they&#8217;re all in
Bloomsbury, W.C. I shall have lessons in shorthand and
typewriting at Pitman&#8217;s School, and then I shall get a
situation. My name will be Vavasour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t. I shall book to Ipswich first and begin
again from there. Girls like me aren&#8217;t so easy to catch
as all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re vehy cunning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get that from mother. She&#8217;s most frightfully cunning
with father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey,&#8221; said Miss Ingate with a strange grin, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know how I can sit here and listen to you. You&#8217;ll
ruin me with your father, because if you go I&#8217;m sure I shall
never be able to keep from him that I knew all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you shouldn&#8217;t have sworn,&#8221; retorted Audrey.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m glad you did swear, because I had to tell somebody,
and there was nobody but you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate might possibly have contrived to employ
some of that sagacity in which she took a secret pride
upon a very critical and urgent situation, had not Mrs.
Moze, with a white handkerchief wrapped round her forehead,
at that moment come into the room. Immediately
the study was full of neuralgia and eau-de-Cologne.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Moze and Miss Ingate at length recovered
from the tenderness of meeting each other after a separation
of ten days or more, Audrey had vanished like an illusion.
She was not afraid of her mother; and she could trust
Miss Ingate, though Miss Ingate and Mrs. Moze were
dangerously intimate; but she was too self-conscious to
remain in the presence of her fellow-creatures; and in spite
of her faith in Miss Ingate she thought of the spinster
as of a vase filled now with a fatal liquor which by any
accident might spill and spread ruin&mdash;so that she could
scarcely bear to look upon Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>At the back of the house a young Pomeranian dog,
which had recently solaced Miss Ingate in the loss of a
Pekingese done to death by a spinster&#8217;s too-nourishing
love, was prancing on his four springs round the chained
yard-dog, his friend and patron. In a series of marvellous
short bounds, he followed Audrey with yapping eagerness
down the slope of the garden; and the yard-dog, aware
that none but the omnipotent deity, Mr. Moze, sole source
of good and evil, had the right to loose him, turned
round once and laid himself flat and long on the ground,
sighing.</p>

<p>The garden, after developing into an orchard and
deteriorating into a scraggy plantation, ended in a low
wall that was at about the level of the sea-wall and
separated from it by a water-course and a strip of very
green meadow. Audrey glanced instinctively back at the
house to see if anybody was watching her.</p>

<p>Flank Hall, which for a hundred years had been called
&#8220;the new hall,&#8221; was a seemly Georgian residence, warm
in colour, with some quaint woodwork; and like most such
buildings in Essex, it made a very happy marriage with
the landscape. Its dormers and fine chimneys glowed amid
the dark bare trees, and they alone would have captivated
a Londoner possessing those precious attributes, fortunately
ever spreading among the enlightened middle-classes, a
motor-car, a cultured taste in architecture, and a desire
to enter the squirearchy. Audrey loathed the house. For
her it was the last depth of sordidness and the commonplace.
She could imagine positively nothing less romantic.
She thought of the ground floor on chill March mornings
with no fires anywhere save a red gleam in the dining-room,
and herself wandering about in it idle, at a loss
for a diversion, an ambition, an effort, a real task; and
she thought of the upper floor, a mainly unoccupied wilderness
of iron bedsteads and yellow chests of drawers and
chipped earthenware and islands of carpets, and her mother
plaintively and weariedly arguing with some servant over
a slop-pail in a corner. The images of the interior, indelibly
printed in her soul, desolated her.</p>

<p>Mozewater she loved, and every souvenir of it was exquisite&mdash;red
barges beating miraculously up the shallow
puddles to Moze Quay, equinoctial spring-tides when the
estuary was a tremendous ocean covered with foam and the
sea-wall felt the light lash of spray, thunderstorms in
autumn gathering over the yellow melancholy of deathlike
sunsets, wild birds crying across miles of uncovered mud at
early morning and duck-hunters crouching in punts behind
a waving screen of delicate grasses to wing them, and the
mysterious shapes of steamers and warships in the offing
beyond the Sand.... The sail of the receding yacht
gleamed now against the Sand, and its flashing broke her
heart; for it was the flashing of freedom. She thought of
the yachtsman; he was very courteous and deferential; a
mild creature; he had behaved to her as to a woman....
Oh! To be the petted and capricious wife of such a man,
to nod commands, to enslave with a smile, to want a thing
and instantly to have it, to be consulted and to decide, to
spend with large gestures, to be charitable, to be adored by
those whom you had saved from disaster, to increase
happiness wherever you went ... and to be free!....</p>

<p>The little dog jumped up at her because he was tired of
being ignored, and she caught him and kissed him again and
again passionately, and he wriggled with ecstasy and licked
her ears with all the love in him. And in kissing him she
kissed grave and affectionate husbands, she kissed the lovely
scenery of the Sound, and she kissed the magnificent ideal
of emancipation. But the dog had soon had enough of her
arms; he broke free, sprang, alighted, and rolled over, and
arose sniffing, with earth on his black muzzle....</p>

<p>He looked up at her inquiringly.... Strange, short-frocked
blue figure looking down at him! She had a bulging
forehead; her brown eyes were tunnelled underneath it.
But what living eyes, what ardent eyes, that blazed up and
sank like a fire! What delicate and exact mirrors of the
secret traffic between her soul and the soul of the world!
She had full cheeks, and a large mouth ripe red, inviting
and provocative. In the midst, an absurd small unprominent
nose that meant nothing! Her complexion was divine, surpassing
all similes. To caress that smooth downy cheek (if
you looked close you could see the infinitesimal down against
the light like an aura on the edge of the silhouette), even to
let the gaze dwell on it, what an enchantment!... She
considered herself piquant and comely, and she was not
deceived. She had long hands.</p>

<p>The wind from afar on her cheek reminded her
poignantly that she was a prisoner. She could not go to the
clustered village on the left, nor into the saltings on the
right, nor even on to the sea-wall where the new rushes and
grasses were showing. All the estuary was barred, and the
winding road that mounted the slope towards Colchester.
Her revolt against injustice was savage. Hatred of her
father surged up in her like glittering lava. She had long
since ceased to try to comprehend him. She despised herself
because she was unreasonably afraid of him, ridiculously
mute before him. She could not understand how anybody
could be friendly with him&mdash;for was he not notorious? Yet
everywhere he was greeted with respect and smiles, and he
would chat at length with all manner of people on a note of
mild and smooth cordiality. He and Miss Ingate would
enjoy together the most enormous talks. She was, however,
aware that Miss Ingate&#8217;s opinion of him was not very
different from her own. Each time she saw her father and
Miss Ingate in communion she would say in her heart to
Miss Ingate: &#8220;You are disloyal to me.&#8221; ...</p>

<p>Was it possible that she had confided to Miss Ingate her
fearful secret? The conversation appeared to her unreal
now. She went over her plan. In the afternoon her father
was always out, and to-morrow afternoon her mother would
be out too. She would have a few things in a light bag that
she could carry&mdash;her mother&#8217;s bag! She would put on her
best clothes and a veil from her mother&#8217;s wardrobe. She
would take the 4.5 p.m. train. The stationmaster would be
at his tea then. Only the booking-clerk and the porter
would see her, and neither would dare to make an observation.
She would ask for a return ticket to Ipswich; that
would allay suspicion, and at Ipswich she would book again.
She had cut out the addresses of the boarding-houses. She
would have to buy things in London. She knew of two
shops&mdash;Harrod&#8217;s and Shoolbred&#8217;s; she had seen their
catalogues. And the very next morning after arrival she
would go to Pitman&#8217;s School. She would change the first
of the £5 notes at the station and ask for plenty of silver.
She glanced at the unlimited wealth still crushed in her
hand, and then she carefully dropped the fortune down the
neck of her frock.... Stealing? She repulsed the idea
with violent disdain. What she had accomplished against
her father was not a crime, but a vengeance.... She
would never be found in London. It was impossible. Her
plan seemed to her to be perfect in each detail, except one.
She was not the right sort of girl to execute it. She was
very shy. She suspected that no other girl could really be
as shy as she was. She recalled dreadful rare moments with
her mother in strange drawing-rooms. Still, she would
execute the plan even if she died of fright. A force within
her would compel her to execute it. This force did not make
for happiness; on the contrary, it uncomfortably scared her;
but it was irresistible.</p>

<p>Something on the brow of the road from Colchester
attracted her attention. It was a handcart, pushed by a
labourer and by Police Inspector Keeble, whom she liked.
Following the handcart over the brow came a loose procession
of villagers, which included no children, because the
children were in school. Except on a Sunday Audrey had
never before seen a procession of villagers, and these
villagers must have been collected out of the fields, for the
procession was going in the direction of, and not away
from, the village. The handcart was covered with a
tarpaulin.... She knew what had happened; she knew
infallibly. Skirting the boundary of the grounds, she
reached the main entrance to Flank Hall thirty seconds
before the handcart. The little dog, delighted in a new
adventure, yapped ecstatically at her heels, and then
bounded onwards to meet the Inspector and the handcart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run and tell yer mother, Miss Moze,&#8221; Inspector
Keeble called out in a carrying whisper. &#8220;There&#8217;s been
an accident. He ditched the car near Ardleigh cross-roads,
trying to avoid some fowls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Moze, hurrying too fast to meet the Bishop of
Colchester, had met a greater than the Bishop.</p>

<p>Audrey glanced an instant with a sick qualm at the outlines
of the shape beneath the tarpaulin, and ran.</p>

<p>In the dining-room, over the speck of fire, Mrs. Moze
and Miss Ingate were locked in a deep intimate gossip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; cried Audrey, and then sank like a sack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! The little thing&#8217;s fainted!&#8221; Miss Ingate exclaimed
in a voice suddenly hoarse.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_3" id="chapter_3" />CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE LEGACY</h3>


<p>Audrey and Miss Ingate were in the late Mathew Moze&#8217;s
study, fascinated&mdash;as much unconsciously as consciously&mdash;by
the thing which since its owner&#8217;s death had grown every
hour more mysterious and more formidable&mdash;the safe. It
was a fine afternoon. The secondary but still grandiose
enigma of the affair, Mr. Cowl, could be heard walking
methodically on the gravel in the garden. Mr. Cowl was
the secretary of the National Reformation Society.</p>

<p>Suddenly the irregular sound of crunching receded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone somewhere else,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so relieved,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;I hope he&#8217;s gone
a long way off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; murmured Audrey, with an air of surprised
superiority.</p>

<p>But in secret Audrey felt just as relieved as Miss Ingate,
despite the fact that, her mother being prostrate, she was
the mistress of the situation, and could have ordered Mr.
Cowl to leave, with the certainty of being obeyed. She was
astonished at her illogical sensations, and she had been frequently
so astonished in the previous four days.</p>

<p>For example, she was free; she knew that she could
impose herself on her mother; never again would she be the
slave of an unreasoning tyrant; yet she was gloomy and
without hope. She had hated the unreasoning tyrant; yet
she felt very sorry for him because he was dead. And
though she felt very sorry for him, she detested hearing the
panegyrics upon him of the village, and particularly of those
persons with whom he had quarrelled; she actually stopped
Miss Ingate in the midst of an enumeration of his good
qualities&mdash;his charm, his smile, his courtesy, his integrity,
et cetera; she could not bear it. She thought that no child
had ever had such a strange attitude to a deceased parent as
hers to Mr. Moze. She had anticipated the inquest with an
awful dread; it proved to be a trifle, and a ridiculous trifle.
In the long weekly letter which she wrote to her adored
school-friend Ethel at Manningtree she had actually likened
the coroner to a pecking fowl! Was it possible that a
daughter could write in such a strain about the inquest on
her father&#8217;s body?</p>

<p>The funeral had seemed a function by itself, with some
guidance from the undertaker and still more from Mr. Cowl.
Villagers and district acquaintances had been many at the
ceremony, but relatives rare. Mr. Moze&#8217;s four younger
brothers were all in the Colonies; Mrs. Moze had apparently
no connections. Madame Piriac, daughter of Mr. Moze&#8217;s
first wife by that lady&#8217;s first husband, had telegraphed
sympathies from Paris. A cousin or so had come in person
from Woodbridge for the day.</p>

<p>It was from the demeanour of these cousins, grave men
twice her age or more, that Audrey had first divined her new
importance in the world. Their deference indicated that in
their opinion the future mistress of Flank Hall was not Mrs.
Moze, but Audrey. Audrey admitted that they were right.
Yet she took no pleasure in issuing commands. She spoke
firmly, but she said to herself: &#8220;There is no backbone to
this firmness, and I am a fraud.&#8221; She had always yearned
for responsibility, yet now that it was in her hand she
trembled, and she would have dropped it and run away from
it as from a bomb, had she not been too cowardly to show
her cowardice.</p>

<p>The instance of Aguilar, the head-gardener and mechanic,
well illustrated her pusillanimity. She loathed Aguilar; her
mother loathed him; the servants loathed him. He had said
at the inquest that the car was in perfect order, but that Mr.
Moze was too excitable to be a good driver. His evidence
was true, but the jury did not care for his manner. Nor did
the village. He had only two good qualities&mdash;honesty and
efficiency; and these by their rarity excited jealousy rather
than admiration. Audrey strongly desired to throw the
gardener-mechanic upon the world; it nauseated her to see
his disobliging face about the garden. But he remained
scathless, to refuse demanded vegetables, to annoy the
kitchen, to pronounce the motor-car utterly valueless, and to
complain of his own liver. Audrey had legs; she had a
tongue; she could articulate. Neither wish nor power was
lacking in her to give Aguilar the supreme experience of his
career. And yet she did not walk up to him and say:
&#8220;Aguilar, please take a week&#8217;s notice.&#8221; Why? The
question puzzled her and lowered her opinion of herself.</p>

<p>She was similarly absurd in the paramount matter of the
safe. The safe could not be opened. The village, having
been thrilled by four stirring days of the most precious and
rare fever, had suffered much after the funeral from a severe
reaction of dullness. It would have suffered much more had
the fact not escaped that the safe could not be opened. In
the deep depression of the day following the funeral the
village could still say to itself: &#8220;Romance and excitement
are not yet over, for the key of the Moze safe is lost, and the
will is in the safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>The village did not know that there were two keys to the
safe and that they were both lost. Nobody knew that except
Audrey and Miss Ingate and Mr. Cowl. The official key was
lost because Mr. Moze&#8217;s key-ring was lost. The theory was
that it had been jerked out of his pocket in the accident.
Persistent search for it had been unsuccessful. As for the
unofficial or duplicate key, Audrey could not remember
where she had put it after her burglary, the conclusion of
which had been disturbed by Miss Ingate. At one moment
she was quite sure that she had left the key in the safe, but
at another moment she was equally sure that she was holding
the key in her right hand (the bank-notes being in her
left) when Miss Ingate entered the room; at still another
moment she was almost convinced that before Miss Ingate&#8217;s
arrival she had run to the desk and slipped the key back
into its drawer. In any case the second key was irretrievable.
She discussed the dilemma very fully with Miss Ingate, who
had obligingly come to stay in the house. They examined
every aspect of the affair, except Audrey&#8217;s guiltiness of
theft, which both of them tacitly ignored. In the end they
decided that it might be wiser not to conceal Audrey&#8217;s
knowledge of the existence of a second key; and they told
Mr. Cowl, because he happened to be at hand. In so doing
they were ill-advised, because Mr. Cowl at once acted in a
characteristic and inconvenient fashion which they ought to
have foreseen.</p>

<p>On the day before the funeral Mr. Cowl had telegraphed
from some place in Devonshire that he should represent
the National Reformation Society at the funeral, and asked
for a bed, on the pretext that he could not get from
Devonshire to Moze in time for the funeral if he postponed
his departure until the next morning. The telegram was
quite costly. He arrived for dinner, a fat man about thirty-eight,
with chestnut hair, a low, alluring voice, and a small
handbag for luggage. Miss Ingate thought him very
interesting, and he was. He said little about the National
Reformation Society, but a great deal about the late Mr.
Moze, of whom he appeared to be an intimate friend;
presumably the friendship had developed at meetings of
the Society. After dinner he strolled nonchalantly to the
sideboard and opened a box of the deceased&#8217;s cigars, and
suggested that, as he was well acquainted with the brand,
having often enjoyed the hospitality of Mr. Moze&#8217;s cigar-case,
he should smoke a cigar now to the memory of the
departed. Miss Ingate then began to feel alarmed. He
smoked four cigars to the memory of the departed, and on
retiring ventured to take four more for consumption during
the night, as he seldom slept.</p>

<p>In the morning he went into the bathroom at eight
o&#8217;clock and remained there till noon, reading and smoking
in continually renewed hot water. He descended blandly,
begged Miss Moze not to trouble about his breakfast, and
gently assumed a certain control of the funeral. After the
funeral he announced that he should leave on the morrow;
but the mystery of the safe held him to the house. When
he heard of the existence of the second key he organised
and took command of a complete search of the study, and
in the course of the search he inspected every document
in the study. He said he knew that the deceased had
left a legacy to the Society, and he should not feel justified
in quitting Moze until the will was found.</p>

<p>Now in these circumstances Audrey ought certainly to
have telegraphed to her father&#8217;s solicitor at Chelmsford
at once. In the alternative she ought to have hired a
safe-opening expert or a burglar from Colchester. She
had accomplished neither of these downright things. With
absolute power, she had done nothing but postpone. She
wondered at herself, for up to her father&#8217;s death she had
been a great critic of absolute power.</p>

<hr />

<p>The heavy policemanish step of Mr. Cowl was heard
on the landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming down on us!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Ingate,
partly afraid, and partly ironic at her own fear. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure he&#8217;s coming down on us. Audrey, I liked that man
at first, but now I tremble before him. And I&#8217;m sure his
moustache is dyed. Can&#8217;t you ask him to leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is his moustache dyed, Winnie? Oh, what fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate&#8217;s apprehension was justified. There was
a knock at the study door, discreet, insistent, menacing,
and it was Mr. Cowl&#8217;s knock. He entered, smiling
gravely and yet, as it were, teasingly. His easy bigness,
florid and sinister, made a disturbing contrast with the
artless and pure simplicity of Audrey in her new black robe,
and even with Miss Ingate&#8217;s pallid maturity, which, after all,
was passably innocent and ingenuous. Mr. Cowl resembled
a great beast good-humouredly lolloping into the cage in
which two rabbits had been placed for his diversion and
hunger.</p>

<p>Pulling a key from the pocket of his vast waistcoat,
he said in his quiet voice, so seductive and ominous:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the key of the safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>He offered it delicately to Audrey.</p>

<p>It was the key of the safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they find it in the ditch?&#8221; Audrey demanded,
blushing, for she knew that the key had not been found
in the ditch; she knew by a certain indentation on it that it
was the duplicate key which she herself had mislaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mr. Cowl. &#8220;I found it myself, and not
in the ditch. I remembered you had said that you had
changed at the dressmaker&#8217;s in the village and had left
there an old frock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; murmured Audrey, with a deeper blush.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowl nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the happy idea that you might have had the
key and left it in the pocket of the frock. So I trotted
down to the dressmaker&#8217;s and asked for the frock, in your
name, and lo! the result!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the key lying in Audrey&#8217;s long hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how should I have had the key, Mr. Cowl? Why
should I have had the key?&#8221; Audrey burst out like a
simpleton.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, Miss Moze,&#8221; said he, with a peculiar grin and
in an equally peculiar tone, &#8220;is a matter about which
obviously you are better informed than I am. Shall we
try the key?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smooth undeniable gesture he took the key
again from Audrey, and bent his huge form to open the
safe. As he did so Miss Ingate made a sarcastic and yet
affrighted face at Audrey, and Audrey tried to send a signal
in reply, but failed, owing to imperfect self-control. However,
she managed to say to Mr. Cowl&#8217;s curved back:</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have found the key in the pocket of
my old frock, Mr. Cowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; he inquired benevolently, raising and
turning his chestnut head. Even in that exciting instant
Audrey could debate within herself whether or not his
superb moustache was dyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it has no pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I discovered,&#8221; said Mr. Cowl, after a little pause.
&#8220;I merely stated that I had the happy idea&mdash;for it proved
to be a happy idea&mdash;that you might have left the key in
the pocket. I discovered it, as a fact, in a slit of the
lining of the belt.... Conceivably you had slipped it in
there&mdash;in a hurry.&#8221; He put strange implications into the
last three words. &#8220;Yes, it is the authentic key,&#8221; he
concluded, as the door of the safe swung heavily and
silently open.</p>

<p>Audrey, for the first time, felt rather like a thief as
she beheld the familiar interior of the safe which a few
days earlier she had so successfully rifled. &#8220;Is it possible,&#8221;
she thought, &#8220;that I really took bank-notes out of that
safe, and that they are at this very moment in my bedroom
between the leaves of &#8216;Pictures of Palestine&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cowl was cautiously fumbling among the serried
row of documents which, their edges towards the front,
filled the steel shelf above the drawers. Audrey had never
experienced any curiosity concerning the documents. Lucre
alone had interested the base creature. No documents
would have helped her to freedom. But now she thought
apprehensively: &#8220;My fate may be among those documents.&#8221;
She was quite prepared to learn that her father had done
something silly in his will.</p>

<p>&#8220;This resembles a testament,&#8221; said Mr. Cowl, smiling
to himself, and pulling out a foolscap scrip, folded and
endorsed. &#8220;Yes. Dated last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>He unfolded the document; a letter slipped from the
interior of it; he placed the letter on the small occasional
table next to the desk, and offered the will to Audrey with
precisely the same gesture as he had offered the key.</p>

<p>Audrey tried to decipher the will, and completely failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you read it, Miss Ingate?&#8221; she muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t!&#8221; answered Miss Ingate in excitement.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t. I never could read wills. They&#8217;re
so funny, somehow. And I haven&#8217;t got my spectacles.&#8221;
She flushed slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;May <em>I</em> venture to tell you what it contains?&#8221; Mr.
Cowl suggested. &#8220;There can be no indiscretion on my
part, as all wills after probate are public property and
can be inspected by any Tom, Dick or Harry for a fee
of one shilling.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the document and gazed at it intently, turning
over a page and turning back, for an extraordinarily
long time.</p>

<p>Audrey said to herself again and again, with exasperated
impatience: &#8220;He knows now, and I don&#8217;t know. He
knows now, and I don&#8217;t know. He knows now, and I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length Mr. Cowl spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a perfectly simple will. The testator leaves the
whole of his property to Mrs. Moze for life, and afterwards
to you, Miss Moze. There are only two legacies.
Ten pounds to James Aguilar, gardener. And the testator&#8217;s
shares in the Zacatecas Oil Development Corporation to the
National Reformation Society. I may say that the testator
had expressed to me his intention of leaving these shares
to the Society. We should have preferred money, free
of legacy duty, but the late Mr. Moze had a reason for
everything he did. I must now bid you good-bye, ladies,&#8221;
he went on strangely, with no pause. &#8220;Miss Moze, will
you convey my sympathetic respects to your mother and
my thanks for her most kind hospitality? My grateful
sympathies to yourself. Good-bye, Miss Ingate....
Er, Miss Ingate, why do you look at me in that
peculiar way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Cowl, you&#8217;re a very peculiar man. May
I ask whether you were born in this part of the
country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Clacton, Miss Ingate,&#8221; answered Mr. Cowl imperturbably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; said Miss Ingate, and the corners of her
lips went sardonically down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t trouble to come downstairs,&#8221; said Mr.
Cowl. &#8220;My bag is packed. I have tipped the parlourmaid,
and there is just time to catch the train,&#8221;</p>

<p>He departed, leaving the two women speechless.</p>

<p>After a moment, Miss Ingate said dryly:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was so very peculiar I knew he must belong to
these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he know I left my blue frock at Miss
Pannell&#8217;s?&#8221; cried Audrey. &#8220;I never told him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been eavesdropping!&#8221; cried Miss Ingate.
&#8220;He never found the key in your frock. He must have
found it here somewhere; I feel sure it must have dropped
by the safe, and I lay anything he had opened the safe
before and read the will before. I could tell from the
way he looked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should he suppose that I&#8217;d the key?&#8221;
Audrey put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eavesdropping! I&#8217;m convinced that man knows too
much.&#8221; Audrey reddened once more. &#8220;I believe he thought
you&#8217;d be capable of burning the will. That&#8217;s why he made
you handle it in his presence and mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Winnie,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;I think you might have
told him all that while he was here, instead of letting
him go off so triumphant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did begin to,&#8221; said Miss Ingate with a snigger.
&#8220;But you wouldn&#8217;t back me up, you little coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never be a coward again!&#8221; Audrey said
violently.</p>

<p>They read the will together. They had no difficulty at
all in comprehending it now that they were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do think it&#8217;s a horrid shame Aguilar should have
that ten pounds,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;But otherwise I don&#8217;t
care. You can&#8217;t guess how relieved I am, Winnie. I
imagined the most dreadful things. I don&#8217;t know what
I imagined. But now we shall have all the property and
everything, just as much as ever there was, and only me
and mother to spend it.&#8221; Audrey danced an embryonic
jig. &#8220;Won&#8217;t I keep mother in order! Winnie, I shall
make her go with me to Paris. I&#8217;ve always wanted to
know that Madame Piriac&mdash;she does write such funny
English in her letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re saying?&#8221; murmured Miss Ingate,
who had picked up the letter which Mr. Cowl had laid
on the small table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say I shall make mother go to Paris with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;Because she won&#8217;t
go. I know your mother better than you do.... Oh!
Audrey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey saw Miss Ingate&#8217;s face turn scarlet from the
roots of her hair to her chin.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate had dropped the letter. Audrey snatched it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Moze,&#8221; the letter ran. &#8220;I send you herewith
a report of the meeting of the Great Mexican Oil Company at
New York. You will see that they duly authorised the contract
by which the Zacatecas Oil Corporation transfers our
property to them in exchange for shares at the rate of four
Great Mexican shares for one Zacatecas share. As each of
the Development Syndicate shares represents ten of the
Corporation shares, and as on my recommendation you put
£4,500 into the Syndicate, you will therefore own 180,000
Great Mexican shares. They are at present above par.
Mark my words, they will be worth from seven to ten dollars
apiece in a year&#8217;s time. I think you now owe me a good
turn, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter was signed with a name unknown to either
of them, and it was dated from Coleman Street, E.C.</p>

<h3>MR. FOULGER</h3>


<p>Half an hour later the woman and the girl, still in the study
and severely damaged by the culminating events of Mr.
Cowl&#8217;s visit, were almost prostrated by the entirely unexpected
announcement of the arrival of Mr. Foulger. Mr.
Foulger was the late Mr. Moze&#8217;s solicitor from Chelmsford.
Audrey&#8217;s first thought was: &#8220;Has heaven telegraphed to
him on my behalf?&#8221; But her next was that all the solicitors
in the world would now be useless in the horrible calamity
that had befallen.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that Audrey was no worse off than
before the discovery of the astounding value of the
Zacatecas shares. The Moze property, inherited through
generations and consisting mainly in farms and tithe-rents,
was not in the slightest degree impaired. On the contrary,
the steady progress of agriculture in Essex indicated that its
yield must improve with years. Nevertheless Audrey felt as
though she and her mother were ruined, and as though the
National Reformation Society had been guilty of a fearful
crime against a widow and an orphan. The lovely vision of
immeasurable wealth had flashed and scintillated for a month
in front of her dazzled eyes&mdash;and then blackness, nothingness,
the dark void! She knew that she would never be
happy again.</p>

<p>And she thought, scornfully, &#8220;How could father
have been so preoccupied and so gloomy, with all those
riches?&#8221; She could not conceive anybody as rich as her
father secretly was not being day and night in a condition
of pure delight at the whole spectacle of existence.
Her opinion of Mathew Moze fell lower than ever, and
fell finally.</p>

<p>The parlourmaid, in a negligence of attire indicating that
no man was left alive in the house, waited at the door of the
study to learn whether or not Miss Moze was in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll <em>have</em> to see him,&#8221; said Miss Ingate firmly.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be all right. I&#8217;ve known him all my life. He&#8217;s a very
nice man.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the parlourmaid had gone, and while Audrey was
upbraiding her for not confessing earlier her acquaintance
with Mr. Foulger, Miss Ingate added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Only his wife has a wooden leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mr. Foulger entered. He was a shortish man of
about fifty, with a paunch, but not otherwise fat; dressed
like a sportsman. He trod very lightly. The expression on
his ruddy face was amiable but extremely alert, hardening at
intervals into decision or caution. He saw before him a
nervous, frowning girl in inelegant black, and Miss Ingate
with a curious look in her eyes and a sardonic and timid
twitching of her lips. For an instant he was discountenanced;
but he at once recovered, accomplishing a
bright salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are at last, Mr. Foulger!&#8221; Miss Ingate
responded. &#8220;But you&#8217;re too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>These mysterious words, and the speechlessness of
Audrey, upset him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was away in Somersetshire for a little fishing,&#8221; he
said, after he had deplored the death of Mr. Moze, the illness
of Mrs. Moze, and the bereavement of Miss Moze, and had
congratulated Miss Moze on the protective friendship of his
old friend, Miss Ingate. &#8220;I was away for a little fishing,
and I only heard the sad news when I got back home at
noon to-day. I came over at once.&#8221; He cleared his throat
and looked first at Audrey and then at Miss Ingate. He felt
that he ought to be addressing Audrey, but somehow he
could not help addressing Miss Ingate instead. His grey
legs were spread abroad as he sat very erect on a chair,
and between them his dependent paunch found a comfortable
space for itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have been getting anxious about the will.
I have brought it with me,&#8221; he said. He drew a white
document from the breast-pocket of his cutaway coat, and
he perched a pair of eyeglasses carelessly on his nose. &#8220;It
was executed before your birth, Miss Moze. But a will
keeps like wine. The whole of the property of every
description is left to Mrs. Moze, and she is sole executrix. If
she should predecease the testator, then everything is left
to his child or children. Not perhaps a very businesslike
will&mdash;a will likely to lead to unforeseen complications, but the
sort of will that a man in the first flush of marriage often
does make, and there is no stopping him. Your father had
almost every quality, but he was not businesslike&mdash;if I may
say so with respect. However, I confess that for the present
I see no difficulties. Of course the death duties will
have to be paid, but your father always kept a considerable
amount of money at call. When I say &#8216;considerable,&#8217; I
mean several thousands. That was a point on which he and
I had many discussions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Foulger glanced around with satisfaction. Already
the prospect of legal business and costs had brought about
a change in his official demeanour of an adviser truly
bereaved by the death of a client. He saw the young girl,
gazing fiercely at the carpet, suddenly begin to weep. This
phenomenon, to which he was not unaccustomed, did not by
itself disturb him; but the face of Miss Ingate gave him
strange apprehensions, which reached a climax when Miss
Ingate, obviously not at all at ease, muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a later will, Mr. Foulger. It was made last
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he breathed, scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>He thought he did see. He thought he understood why
he had been kept waiting, why Mrs. Moze pretended to be
ill, why the girl had frowned, why the naively calm Miss
Ingate was in such a state of nerves. The explanation was
that he was not wanted. The explanation was that Mr.
Moze had changed his solicitor. His face hardened, for he
and his uncle between them had &#8220;acted&#8221; for the Moze
family for over seventy years.</p>

<p>He rose from the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I need not trouble you any longer,&#8221; he said in a
firm tone, and turned with real dignity to leave.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly astonished when with one swift
movement Audrey rose, and flashed like a missile to the door,
and stood with her back to it. The fact was that Audrey
had just remembered her vow never again to be afraid of
anybody. When Miss Ingate with extraordinary agility also
jumped up and approached him, he apprehended, recalling
rumours of Miss Ingate&#8217;s advanced feminism, that the fate
of an anti-suffragette Cabinet Minister might be awaiting
him, and he prepared his defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my solicitor, whatever mother may say, and
you mustn&#8217;t go,&#8221; added Audrey in a soft voice.</p>

<p>The man was entranced. It occurred to him that
he would have a tale to tell and to re-tell at his club
for years, about &#8220;a certain fair client who shall be
nameless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next minute he had heard a somewhat romantic, if
not hysterical, version of the facts of the case, and he was
perusing the original documents. By chance he read first
the letter about the Zacatecas shares. That Mathew Moze
had made a will without his aid was a shock; that Mathew
Moze had invested money without his advice was another
shock quite as severe. But he knew the status of the Great
Mexican Oil Company, and his countenance lighted as he
realised the rich immensity of the business of proving the
will and devolving the estate; his costs would run to the most
agreeable figures. As soon as he glanced at the testament
which Mr. Cowl had found, he muttered, with satisfaction
and disdain:</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! He made this himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he gazed at it compassionately, as a cabinetmaker
might gaze at a piece of amateur fretwork.</p>

<p>Standing, he read it slowly and with extreme care. And
when he had finished he casually remarked, in the classic
legal phrase:</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t worth the paper it&#8217;s written on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he sat down again, and his neat paunch resumed
its niche between his legs. He knew that he had made a
tremendous effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Miss Ingate began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not worth the paper it&#8217;s written on,&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;There is only one witness, and there ought to be two, and
even the one witness is a bad one&mdash;Aguilar, because he
profits under the will. He would have to give up his legacy
before his attestation could count, and even then it would be
no good alone. Mr. Moze has not even expressly revoked
the old will. If there hadn&#8217;t been a previous will, and if
Aguilar was a thoroughly reliable man, and if the family had
wished to uphold the new will, I dare say the Court <em>might</em>
have pronounced for it. But under the circumstances it
hasn&#8217;t the ghost of a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t the National Reformation Society make
trouble?&#8221; demanded Miss Ingate faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em try!&#8221; said Mr. Foulger, who wished that the
National Reformation Society would indeed try.</p>

<p>Even as he articulated the words, he was aware of
Audrey coming towards him from the direction of the door;
he was aware of her black frock and of her white face, with
its bulging forehead and its deliciously insignificant nose.
She held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a dear!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Her lips seemed to aim uncertainly for his face. Did
they just touch, with exquisite contact, his bristly chin, or
was it a divine illusion? ... She blushed in a very marked
manner. He blinked, and his happy blinking seemed to say:
&#8220;Only wills drawn by me are genuine.... Didn&#8217;t I tell
you Mr. Moze was not a man of business?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey ran to Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Mr. Foulger, suddenly ashamed, and determined to be a
lawyer, said sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Mrs. Moze made a will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother made a will? Oh no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she should make one at once, in your favour, of
course. No time should be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mrs. Moze is ill in bed,&#8221; protested Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more reason why she should make a will. It
may save endless trouble. And it is her duty. I shall
suggest that I be the executor and trustee, of course with
the usual power to charge costs.&#8221; His face was hard again.
&#8220;You will thank me later on, Miss Moze,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean <em>now?</em>&#8220; shrilled Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If you will give me some paper, we
might go to her at once. You can be one of the witnesses.
I could be a witness, but as I am to act under the will for a
consideration somebody else would be preferable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should suggest Aguilar,&#8221; answered Miss Ingate, the
corners of her lips dropping.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate went first, to prepare Mrs. Moze.</p>

<p>When Audrey was alone in the study&mdash;she had not even
offered to accompany her elders to the bedroom&mdash;she made a
long sound: &#8220;Ooo!&#8221; Then she gave a leap and stood still,
staring out of the window at the estuary. She tried to force
her mood to the colour of her dress, but the sense of propriety
was insufficient for the task. The magnificence of all
the world was unfolding itself to her soul. Events had
hitherto so dizzyingly beaten down upon her head that she
had scarcely been conscious of feeling. Now she luxuriously
felt. &#8220;I am at last born,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;Miracles have
happened.... It&#8217;s incredible.... I can do what I like
with mother.... But if I don&#8217;t take care I shall die of
relief this very moment!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_5" id="chapter_5" />CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE DEAD HAND</h3>


<p>Audrey was wakened up that night, just after she had
gone to sleep, by a touch on the cheek. Her mother,
palely indistinct in the darkness, was standing by the bedside.
She wore a white wrap over her night attire, and the
customary white bandage from which emanated a faint odour
of eau-de-Cologne, was around her forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey, darling, I must speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly Audrey became the wise directress of her poor
foolish mother&#8217;s existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said, with firm kindness, &#8220;please do go
back to bed at once. This sort of thing is simply frightful
for your neuralgia. I&#8217;ll come to you in one moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Moze meekly obeyed; she had gone even
before Audrey had had time to light her candle. Audrey
was very content in thus being able to control her mother
and order everything for the best. She guessed that the
old lady had got some idea into her head about the
property, or about her own will, or about the solicitor, or
about a tombstone, and that it was worrying her. She
and Miss Ingate (who had now returned home) had had
a very extensive palaver, in low voices that never ceased,
after the triumphant departure of Mr. Foulger. Audrey
had cautiously protested; she was afraid her mother would
be fatigued, and she saw no reason why her mother should
be acquainted with all the details of a complex matter;
but the gossiping habit of a quarter of a century was too
powerful for Audrey.</p>

<p>In the large parental bedroom the only light was Audrey&#8217;s
candle. Mrs. Moze was lying on the right half of the
great bed, where she had always lain. She might have
lain luxuriously in the middle, with vast spaces at either
hand, but again habit was too powerful.</p>

<p>The girl, all in white, held the candle higher, and the
shadows everywhere shrunk in unison. Mrs. Moze blinked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the candle on the night-table,&#8221; said Mrs. Moze
curtly.</p>

<p>Audrey did so. The bedroom, for her, was full of
the souvenirs of parental authority. Her first recollections
were those of awe in regard to the bedroom. And when
she thought that on that bed she had been born, she had
a very queer sensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided,&#8221; said Mrs. Moze, lying on her back,
and looking up at the ceiling, &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided that your
father&#8217;s wishes must be obeyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About those shares going to the National Reformation
Society. He meant them to go, and they must go to the
Society. I&#8217;ve thought it well over and I&#8217;ve quite decided.
I didn&#8217;t tell Miss Ingate, as it doesn&#8217;t concern her. But
I felt I must tell you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; cried Audrey. &#8220;Have you taken leave of
your senses?&#8221; She shivered; the room was very cold,
and as she shivered her image in the mirror of the wardrobe
shivered, and also her shadow that climbed up the
wall and bent at right-angles at the cornice till it reached
the middle of the ceiling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moze replied obstinately:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not taken leave of my senses, and I&#8217;ll thank
you to remember that I&#8217;m your mother. I have always
carried out your father&#8217;s wishes, and at my time of life
I can&#8217;t alter. Your father was a very wise man. We
shall be as well off as we always were. Better, because
I can save, and I shall save. We have no complaint to
make; I should have no excuse for disobeying your father.
Everything is mine to do as I wish with it, and I shall
give the shares to the Society. What the shares are
worth can&#8217;t affect my duty. Besides, perhaps they aren&#8217;t
worth anything. I always understood that things like that
were always jumping up and down, and generally worthless
in the end.... That&#8217;s all I wanted to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did Audrey seize the candle and walk straight out
of the bedroom, leaving darkness behind her? Was it
because the acuteness of her feelings drove her out, or was
it because she knew instinctively that her mother&#8217;s decision
would prove to be immovable? Perhaps both.</p>

<p>She dropped back into her own bed with a soundless
sigh of exhaustion. She did not blow out the candle, but
lay staring at it. Her dream was annihilated. She foresaw
an interminable, weary and futile future in and about
Moze, and her mother always indisposed, always fretful,
and curiously obstinate in weakness. But Audrey, despite
her tragic disillusion, was less desolated than made solemn.
In the most disturbing way she knew herself to be the
daughter of her father and her mother; and she comprehended
that her destiny could not be broken off suddenly
from theirs. She was touched because her mother deemed
her father a very wise man, whereas she, Audrey, knew
that he was nothing of the sort. She felt sorry for both
of them. She pitied her father, and she was a mother
to her mother. Their relations together, and the mystic
posthumous spell of her father over her mother, impressed
her profoundly.... And she was proud of herself for
having demonstrated her courage by preventing the solicitor
from running away, and extraordinarily ashamed of her
sentimental and brazen behaviour to the solicitor afterwards.
These various thoughts mitigated her despair as
she gazed at the sinking candle. Nevertheless her dream
was annihilated.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_6" id="chapter_6" />CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE YOUNG WIDOW</h3>


<p>It was early October. Audrey stood at the garden door
of Flank Hall.</p>

<p>The estuary, in all the colours of unsettled, mild,
bright weather, lay at her feet beneath a high arch of
changing blue and white. The capricious wind moved in
her hair, moved in the rich grasses of the sea-wall, bent
at a curtseying angle the red-sailed barges, put caps on
the waves in the middle distance, and drew out into long
horizontal scarves the smoke of faint steamers in the
offing.</p>

<p>Audrey was dressed in black, but her raiment had
obviously not been fashioned in the village, nor even at
Colchester, nor yet at Ipswich, that great and stylish city.
She looked older; she certainly had acquired something
of an air of knowledge, assurance, domination, sauciness
and challenge, which qualities were all partly illustrated
in her large, audacious hat. The spirit which the late
Mr. Moze had so successfully suppressed was at length
coming to the surface for all beholders to see, and the
process of evolution begun at the moment when Audrey
had bounced up and prevented an authoritative solicitor
from leaving the study was already advanced. Nevertheless,
at frequent intervals Audrey&#8217;s eyes changed, and she seemed
for an instant to be a very naive, very ingenuous and
wistful little thing&mdash;and this though she had reached the
age of twenty. Perhaps she was feeling sorry for the
girl she used to be.</p>

<p>And no doubt she was also thinking of her mother,
who had died within eight hours of their nocturnal interview.
The death of Mrs. Moze surprised everyone, except possibly
Mrs. Moze. As an unsuspected result of the operation
upon her, an embolism had been wandering in her veins;
it reached the brain, and she expired, to the great loss of
the National Reformation Society. Such was the brief
and simple history. When Audrey stood by the body, she
had felt that if it could have saved her mother she would
have enriched the National Reformation Society with all she
possessed.</p>

<p>Gradually the sense of freedom had grown paramount
in her, and she had undertaken the enterprise of completely
subduing Mr. Foulger to her own ends.</p>

<p>The back hall was carpetless and pictureless, and the
furniture in it was draped in grey-white. Every room in
the abode was in the same state, and, since all the
windows were shuttered, every room lay moribund in a
ghostly twilight. Only the clocks remained alive, probably
thinking themselves immortal. The breakfast things were
washed up and stored away. The last two servants had
already gone. Behind Audrey, forming a hilly background,
were trunks and boxes, a large bunch of flowers encased
in paper, and a case of umbrellas and parasols; the whole
strikingly new, and every single item except the flowers
labelled &#8220;Paris via Charing Cross and Calais.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey opened her black Russian satchel, and the
purse within it. Therein were a little compartment full of
English gold, another full of French gold, another full
of multicoloured French bank-notes; and loose in the satchel
was a blue book of credit-notes, each for five hundred
francs, or twenty pounds&mdash;a thick book! And she would
not have minded much if she had lost the whole satchel
&mdash;it would be so easy to replace the satchel with all its
contents.</p>

<p>Then a small brougham came very deliberately up the
drive. It was the vehicle in which Miss Ingate went
her ways; in accordance with Miss Ingate&#8217;s immemorial
command, it travelled at a walking pace up all the hills
to save the horse, and at a walking pace down all hills
lest the horse should stumble and Miss Ingate be destroyed.
It was now followed by a luggage-cart on which was a
large trunk.</p>

<p>At the same moment Aguilar, the gardener, appeared
from somewhere&mdash;he who had been robbed of a legacy
of ten pounds, but who by his ruthless and incontestable
integrity had secured the job of caretaker of Flank
Hall.</p>

<p>The drivers touched their hats to Audrey and jumped
down, and Miss Ingate, with a blue veil tied like a handkerchief
round her bonnet and chin&mdash;sign that she was a
traveller&mdash;emerged from the brougham, sardonically smiling
at her own and everybody&#8217;s expense, and too excited to
be able to give greetings. The three men started to move
the trunks, and the two women whispered together in
the back-hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey,&#8221; demanded Miss Ingate, with a start, &#8220;what
are those rings on your finger?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;One&#8217;s a wedding ring and the other&#8217;s a mourning ring.
I bought them yesterday at Colchester.... Hsh!&#8221; She
stilled further exclamations from Miss Ingate until the
men were out of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here! Quick!&#8221; she whispered, hastily unlocking
a large hat-case that was left. And Miss Ingate looked
and saw a block toque, entirely unsuitable for a young
girl, and a widow&#8217;s veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I look bewitching in them,&#8221; said Audrey, relocking
the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my child, what does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that I&#8217;m not silly enough to go to Paris
as a girl. I&#8217;ve had more than enough of being a girl.
I&#8217;m determined to arrive in Paris as a young widow. It
will be much better in every way, and far easier for you.
In fact, you&#8217;ll have no chaperoning to do at all. I shall
be the chaperon. Now don&#8217;t say you won&#8217;t go, because
you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have told me before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I oughtn&#8217;t. Nothing could have been more
foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who are you the widow of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Audrey. &#8220;You are a sport, Winnie!
I&#8217;ll tell you all the interesting details in the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another minute Aguilar, gloomy and unbending, had
received the keys of Flank Hall, and the procession crunched
down the drive on its way to the station.</p>

<h3>THE CIGARETTE GIRL</h3>


<p>Audrey did not deem that she had begun truly to live
until the next morning, when they left London, after having
passed a night in the Charing Cross Hotel. During several
visits to London in the course of the summer Audrey had
learnt something about the valuelessness of money in a
metropolis chiefly inhabited by people who were positively
embarrassed by their riches. She knew, for example, that
money being very plentiful and stylish hats very rare, large
quantities of money had to be given for infinitesimal quantities
of hats. The big and glittering shops were full of
people whose pockets bulged with money which they were
obviously anxious to part with in order to obtain goods,
while the proud shop-assistants, secure in the knowledge
that money was naught and goods were everything, did their
utmost, by hauteur and steely negatives, to render any
transaction possible. It was the result of a mysterious
&#8220;Law of Exchange.&#8221; She was aware of this. She had
lost her childhood&#8217;s naive illusions about the sovereignty
of money.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she received one or two shocks on the
journey, which was planned upon the most luxurious scale
that the imagination of Messrs. Thomas Cook &amp; Son could
conceive. There was four pounds and ninepence to pay for
excess luggage at Charing Cross. Half a year earlier four
pounds would have bought all the luggage she could have
got together. She very nearly said to the clerk at the window:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mean shillings?&#8221; But in spite of nervousness,
blushings, and all manner of sensitive reactions to new
experiences, her natural sang-froid and instinctive knowledge
of the world saved her from such a terrible lapse, and she
put down a bank-note without the slightest hint that she was
wondering whether it would not be more advantageous to
throw the luggage away.</p>

<p>The boat was crowded, and the sea and wind full of
menace. Fighting their way along the deck after laden
porters, Audrey and Miss Ingate simultaneously espied the
private cabin list hung in a conspicuous spot. They perused
it as eagerly as if it had been the account of a <em>cause célèbre.</em>
Among the list were two English lords, an Honourable Mrs.,
a baroness with a Hungarian name, several Teutonic names,
and Mrs. Moncreiff.</p>

<p>Audrey blushed deeply at the sign of Mrs. Moncreiff, for
she was Mrs. Moncreiff. Behind the veil, and with the touch
of white in her toque, she might have been any age up to
twenty-eight or so. It would have been impossible to say
that she was a young girl, that she was not versed in the
world, that she had not the whole catechism of men at her
finger-ends. All who glanced at her glanced again&mdash;with
sympathy and curiosity; and the second glance pricked
Audrey&#8217;s conscience, making her feel like a thief. But her
moods were capricious. At one moment she was a thief,
a clumsy fraud, an ignorant ninny, and a suitable prey for
the secret police; and at the next she was very clever,
self-confident, equal to the situation, and enjoying the
situation more than she had ever enjoyed anything, and
determined to prolong the situation indefinitely.</p>

<p>The cabin was very spacious, yet not more so than was
proper, considering that the rent of it came to about sixpence
a minute. There was room, even after all the packages
were stowed, for both of them to lie down. But instead
of lying down they eagerly inspected the little abode. They
found a lavatory basin with hot and cold water taps, but no
hot water and no cold water, no soap and no towels. And
they found a crystal water-bottle, but it was empty. Then
a steward came and asked them if they wanted anything,
and because they were miserable poltroons they smiled and
said &#8220;No.&#8221; They were secretly convinced that all the other
private cabins, inhabited by titled persons and by financiers,
were superior to their cabin, and that the captain of the
steamer had fobbed them off with an imitation of a real cabin.</p>

<p>Then it was that Miss Ingate, who since Charing Cross
had been a little excited by a glimpsed newspaper contents-bill
indicating suffragette riots that morning, perceived,
through the open door of the cabin, a most beautiful and
most elegant girl, attired impeccably in that ritualistic garb
of travel which the truly cosmopolitan wear on combined
rail-and-ocean journeys and on no other occasions. It was
at once apparent that the celestial creature had put on that
special hat, that special veil, that special cloak, and those
special gloves because she was deeply aware of what was
correct, and that she would not put them on again until
destiny took her again across the sea, and that if destiny
never did take her again across the sea never again would
she show herself in the vestments, whose correctness was
only equalled by their expensiveness.</p>

<p>The young woman, however, took no thought of her impressive
clothes. She was existing upon quite another plane.
Miss Ingate, preoccupied by the wrongs and perils of her
sex, and momentarily softened out of her sardonic irony,
suspected that they might be in the presence of a victim of
oppression or neglect. The victim lay Half-prone upon the
hard wooden seat against the ship&#8217;s rail. Her dark eyes
opened piteously at times, and her exquisite profile, surmounted
by the priceless hat all askew, made a silhouette
now against the sea and now against the distant white cliffs
of Albion, according to the fearful heaving of the ship.
Spray occasionally dashed over her. She heeded it not. A
few feet farther off she would have been sheltered by a
weather-awning, but, clinging fiercely to the rail, she would
not move.</p>

<p>Then a sharp squall of rain broke, but she entirely ignored
the rain.</p>

<p>The next moment Miss Ingate and Audrey, rushing forth,
had gently seized her and drawn her into their cabin. They
might have succoured other martyrs to the modern passion
for moving about, for there were many; but they chose this
particular martyr because she was so wondrously dressed,
and also perhaps a little because she was so young. As she
lay on the cabin sofa she looked still younger; she looked a
child. Yet when Miss Ingate removed her gloves in order
to rub those chill, fragile, and miraculously manicured hands,
a wedding ring was revealed. The wedding ring rendered
her intensely romantic in the eyes of Audrey and Miss Ingate,
who both thought, in private:</p>

<p>&#8220;She must be the wife of one of those lords!&#8221;</p>

<p>Every detail of her raiment, as she was put at her ease,
showed her to be clothed in precisely the manner which
Audrey and Miss Ingate thought peeresses always were
clothed. Hence, being English, they mingled respect with
their solacing pity. Nevertheless, their respect was tempered
by a peculiar pride, for both of them, in taking lemonade
on the Pullman, had taken therewith a certain preventive
or remedy which made them loftily indifferent to the heaving
of ships and the eccentricities of the sea. The specific had
done all that was claimed for it&mdash;which was a great deal&mdash;so
much so that they felt themselves superwomen among
a cargo of flaccid and feeble sub-females. And they grew
charmingly conceited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I in my cabin?&#8221; murmured the martyr, about a
quarter of an hour after Miss Ingate, having obtained soda
water, had administered to her a dose of the miraculous
specific.</p>

<p>Her delicious cheeks were now a delicate crimson. But
they had been of a delicate crimson throughout.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;You&#8217;re in ours. Which is
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on the other side of the ship, then. I came out for
a little air. But I couldn&#8217;t get back. I&#8217;d just as lief have
died as shift from that seat out there by the railings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the accent, something in those fine English
words &#8220;lief&#8221; and &#8220;shift,&#8221; destroyed in the minds of Audrey
and Miss Ingate the agreeable notion that they had a peeress
on their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your husband on board?&#8221; asked Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;He just is,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;He&#8217;s in our cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I fetch him?&#8221; Miss Ingate suggested. The
corners of her lips had begun to fall once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; said the young woman. &#8220;It&#8217;s Lord Southminster.
I&#8217;m Lady Southminster.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two saviours were thrilled. Each felt that she had
misinterpreted the accent, and that probably peeresses did
habitually use such words as &#8220;lief&#8221; and &#8220;shift.&#8221; The
corners of Miss Ingate&#8217;s lips rose to their proper position.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look for the number on the cabin list,&#8221; said she
hastily, and went forth with trembling to summon the peer.</p>

<p>As Audrey, alone in the cabin with Lady Southminster,
bent curiously over the prostrate form, Lady Southminster
exclaimed with an air of childlike admiration:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re real ladies, you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Audrey felt old and experienced. She decided that
Lady Southminster could not be more than seventeen, and it
seemed to be about half a century since Audrey was seventeen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t come,&#8221; announced Miss Ingate breathlessly,
returning to the cabin, and supporting herself against the
door as the solid teak sank under her feet. &#8220;Oh yes! He&#8217;s
there all right. It was Number 12. I&#8217;ve seen him. I told
him, but I don&#8217;t think he heard me&mdash;to understand, that
is. If you ask me, he couldn&#8217;t come if forty wives sent
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, couldn&#8217;t he!&#8221; observed Lady Southminster, sitting
up. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t he!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the boat was within ten minutes of France, the
remedy had had such an effect upon her that she could walk
about. Accompanied by Audrey she managed to work her
way round the cabin-deck to No. 12. It was empty, save
for hand-luggage! The two girls searched, as well as they
could, the whole crowded ship for Lord Southminster, and
found him not. Lady Southminster neither fainted nor wept.
She merely said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! All right! If that&#8217;s it....!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hand-luggage was being collected. But Lady Southminster
would not collect hers, nor allow it to be collected.
She agreed with Miss Ingate and Audrey that her husband
must ultimately reappear either on the quay or in the train.
While they were all standing huddled together in the throng
waiting for the gangway to put ashore, she said in a low
casual tone, à propos of nothing:</p>

<p>&#8220;I only married him the day before yesterday. I don&#8217;t
know whether you know, but I used to make cigarettes in
Constantinopoulos&#8217;s window in Piccadilly. I don&#8217;t see why
I should be ashamed of it, d&#8217;you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;But it <em>is</em> rather
romantic, isn&#8217;t it, Audrey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite the terrific interest of the adventure of the
cigarette girl, disappointment began immediately after landing.
This France, of which Audrey had heard so much and
dreamed so much, was a very ramshackle and untidy and
one-horse affair. The custom-house was rather like a battlefield
without any rules of warfare; the scene in the refreshment-room
was rather like a sack after a battle; the station
was a desert with odd files of people here and there; the
platforms were ridiculous, and you wanted a pair of steps to
get up into the train. Whatever romance there might be in
France had been brought by Audrey in her secret heart and
by Lady Southminster.</p>

<p>Audrey had come to France, and she was going to Paris,
solely because of a vision which had been created in her by
the letters and by the photographs of Madame Piriac.
Although Madame Piriac and she had absolutely no tie of
blood, Madame Piriac being the daughter by a first husband
of the French widow who became the first Mrs. Moze&mdash;and
speedily died, Audrey persisted privately in regarding
Madame Piriac as a kind of elder sister. She felt a very
considerable esteem for Madame Piriac, upon whom she had
never set eyes, and Madame Piriac had certainly given her
the impression that France was to England what paradise is
to purgatory. Further, Audrey had fallen in love with
Madame Piriac&#8217;s portraits, whose elegance was superb. And
yet, too, Audrey was jealous of Madame Piriac, and
especially so since the attainment of freedom and wealth.
Madame Piriac had most warmly invited her, after the death
of Mrs. Moze, to pay a long visit to Paris as a guest in her
home. Audrey had declined&mdash;from jealousy. She would not
go to Madame Piriac&#8217;s as a raw girl, overdone with money,
who could only speak one language and who knew nothing
at all of this our planet. She would go, if she went, as a
young woman of the world who could hold her own in any
drawing-room, be it Madame Piriac&#8217;s or another. Hence
Miss Ingate had obtained the address of a Paris boarding-house,
and one or two preliminary introductions from political
friends in London.</p>

<p>Well, France was not equal to its reputation; and Miss
Ingate&#8217;s sardonic smile seemed to be saying: &#8220;So this is
your France!&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the excitement of escorting the youngest
English peeress to Paris sufficed for Audrey, even if it did
not suffice for Miss Ingate with her middle-aged apprehensions.
They knew that Lady Southminster was the
youngest English peeress because she had told them so. At
the very moment when they were dispatching a telegram for
her to an address in London, she had popped out the
remark: &#8220;Do you know I&#8217;m the youngest peeress in England?&#8221;
And truth shone in her candid and simple smile.
They had not found the peer, neither on the ship, nor on the
quay, nor in the station. And the peeress would not wait.
She was indeed obviously frightened at the idea of remaining
in Calais alone, even till the next express. She said that her
husband&#8217;s &#8220;man&#8221; would meet the train in Paris. She ate
plenteously with Audrey and Miss Ingate in the refreshment-room,
and she would not leave them nor allow them to leave
her. The easiest course was to let her have her way, and
she had it.</p>

<p>By dint of Miss Ingate&#8217;s unscrupulous tricks with small
baggage they contrived to keep a whole compartment to
themselves. As soon as the train started the peeress began
to cry. Then, wiping her heavenly silly eyes, and upbraiding
herself, she related to her protectresses the glory of a new
manicure set. Unfortunately she could not show them the
set, as it had been left in the cabin. She was actually in
possession of nothing portable except her clothes, some
English magazines bought at Calais, and a handbag which
contained much money and many bonbons.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done it on purpose,&#8221; she said to Audrey as soon
as Miss Ingate went off to take tea in the tea-car. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure he&#8217;s done it on purpose. He&#8217;s hidden himself, and he&#8217;ll
turn up when he thinks he&#8217;s beaten me. D&#8217;you know why
I wouldn&#8217;t bring that luggage away out of the cabin?
Because we had a quarrel about it, at the station, and he
said things to me. In fact we weren&#8217;t speaking. And we
weren&#8217;t speaking last night either. The radiator of his&mdash;our&mdash;car
leaked, and we had to come home from the Coliseum
in a motor-bus. He couldn&#8217;t get a taxi. It wasn&#8217;t his fault,
but a friend of mine told me the day before I was married
that a lady always ought to be angry when her husband
can&#8217;t get a taxi after the theatre&mdash;she says it does &#8217;em good.
So first I told him he mustn&#8217;t leave me to look for one.
Then I said I&#8217;d wait where I was, and then I said we&#8217;d walk
on, and then I said we must take a motor-bus. It was that
that finished him. He said: &#8216;Did I expect him to invent a
taxi when there wasn&#8217;t one?&#8217; And he swore. So of course
I sulked. You must, you know. And my shoes were too
thin and I felt chilly. But only a fortnight before I was
making cigarettes in the window of Constantinopoulos&#8217;s.
Funny, isn&#8217;t it? Otherwise he&#8217;s behaved splendid. Still,
what I do say is a man&#8217;s no right to be ill when he&#8217;s taking
you to Paris on your honeymoon. I knew he was going to
be ill when I left him in the cabin, but he stuck me out he
wasn&#8217;t. A man that&#8217;s so bad he can&#8217;t come to his wife when
<em>she&#8217;s</em> bad isn&#8217;t a man&mdash;that&#8217;s what I say. Don&#8217;t you think
so? You know all about that sort of thing, I lay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey said briefly that she did think so, glad that the
peeress&#8217;s intense and excusable interest in herself kept her
from being curious about others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage ain&#8217;t all chocolate-creams,&#8221; said the peeress
after a pause. &#8220;Have one?&#8221; And she opened her bag very
hospitably.</p>

<p>Then she turned to her magazines. And no sooner had
she glanced at the cover of the second one than she gave
a squeal, and, fetching deep breaths, passed the periodical to
Audrey. At the top of the cover was printed in large letters
the title of a story by a famous author of short tales. It
ran:</p>

<p class="quotation">&#8220;MAN OVERBOARD.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henceforward a suspicion that had lain concealed in the
undergrowth of the hearts of the two girls stalked boldly
about in full daylight.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done it, and he&#8217;s done it to spite me!&#8221; murmured
Lady Southminster tearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; Audrey protested. &#8220;Even if he had fallen
overboard he&#8217;d have been seen and the captain would have
stopped the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; Lady Southminster
retorted with disdain. &#8220;That&#8217;s an <em>omen</em>, that is"&mdash;pointing
to the words on the cover of the magazine. &#8220;What else
could it be? I ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Miss Ingate returned the child was fast asleep.
Miss Ingate was paler than usual. Having convinced herself
that the sleeper did genuinely sleep, she breathed to Audrey:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the next compartment! ... He must have
hidden himself till nearly the last minute on the boat and then
got into the train while we were sending off that telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey blenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you wake her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake her, and have a scene&mdash;with us here? No, I
shan&#8217;t. He&#8217;s a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;you know?&#8221; asked Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he must have been a fool to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; whispered Audrey. &#8220;If I&#8217;d been a man I&#8217;d have
married that face like a shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be all right if he&#8217;d only married the face. But
he&#8217;s married what she calls her mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he young?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And as good-looking in his own way as she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Countess of Southminster stirred, and the slight
movement stopped conversation.</p>

<p>The journey was endless, but it was no longer than the
sleep of the Countess. At length dusk and mist began to
gather in the hollows of the land; stations succeeded one
another more frequently. The reflections of the electric
lights in the compartment could be seen beyond the glass of
the windows. The train still ruthlessly clattered and shook
and swayed and thundered; and weary lords, ladies and
financiers had read all the illustrated magazines and six-penny
novels in existence, and they lolled exhausted and
bored amid the debris of literature and light refreshments.
Then the speed of the convoy slackened, and Audrey, looking
forth, saw a pale cathedral dome resting aloft amid dark
clouds. It was a magical glimpse, and it was the first
glimpse of Paris. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Audrey, far more like a girl
than a widow. The train rattled through defiles of high
twinkling houses, roared under bridges, screeched, threaded
forests of cold blue lamps, and at last came to rest under a
black echoing vault.</p>

<p>Paris!</p>

<p>And, mysteriously, all Audrey&#8217;s illusions concerning
France had been born again. She was convinced that Paris
could not fail to be paradisiacal.</p>

<p>Lady Southminster awoke.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously a young man very well dressed
passed along the corridor. Lady Southminster, with an
awful start, seized her bag and sprang after him, but was
impeded by other passengers. She caught him only after
he had descended to the platform, which was at the bottom
of a precipice below the windows. He had just been saluted
by, and given orders to, a waiting valet. She caught
him sharply by the arm. He shook free and walked quickly
away up the platform, guided by a wise instinct for avoiding
a scene in front of fellow-travellers. She followed close
after him, talking with rapidity. They receded. Audrey
and Miss Ingate leaned out of the windows to watch, and
still farther and farther out. Just as the honeymooning
pair disappeared altogether their two forms came into
contact, and Audrey&#8217;s eyes could see the arm of Lord
Southminster take the arm of Lady Southminster. They
vanished from view like one flesh. And Audrey and Miss
Ingate, deserted, forgotten utterly, unthanked, buffeted by
passengers and by the valet who had climbed up into the
carriage to take away the impedimenta of his master, gazed
at each other and then burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s marriage!&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;That&#8217;s love. I&#8217;ve seen a
deal of love in my time, ever since my sister Arabella&#8217;s
first engagement, but I never saw any that wasn&#8217;t vehy,
vehy queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope they&#8217;ll be happy,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; said Miss Ingate.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_8" id="chapter_8" />CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>EXPLOITATION OF WIDOWHOOD</h3>


<p>The carriage had emptied, and the two adventurers stood
alone among empty compartments. The platform was also
empty. Not a porter in sight. One after the other, the
young widow and the elderly spinster, their purses bulging
with money, got their packages by great efforts down on
to the platform.</p>

<p>An employee strolled past.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Porteur?</em>&#8221; murmured Audrey timidly.</p>

<p>The man sniggered, shrugged his shoulders, and
vanished.</p>

<p>Audrey felt that she had gone back to her school days.
She was helpless, and Miss Ingate was the same. She
wished ardently that she was in Moze again. She could
not imagine how she had been such a fool as to undertake
this absurd expedition which could only end in ridicule
and disaster. She was ready to cry. Then another employee
appeared, hesitated, and picked up a bag, scowling and
inimical. Gradually the man, very tousled and dirty,
clustered all the bags and parcels around his person, and
walked off. Audrey and Miss Ingate meekly following.
The great roof of the station resounded to whistles and
the escape of steam and the clashing of wagons.</p>

<p>Beyond the platforms there were droves of people, of
whom nearly every individual was preoccupied and hurried.
And what people! Audrey had in her heart expected a
sort of glittering white terminus full of dandiacal men
and elegant Parisiennes who had stepped straight out of
fashion-plates, and who had no cares&mdash;for was not this
Paris? Whereas, in fact, the multitude was the dingiest
she had ever seen. Not a gleam of elegance! No hint of
dazzling colour! No smiling and satiric beauty! They
were just persons.</p>

<p>At last, after formalities, Audrey and Miss Ingate
reached the foul and chilly custom-house appointed for the
examination of luggage. Unrecognisable peers and other
highnesses stood waiting at long counters, forming bays,
on which was nothing at all. Then, far behind, a truck
hugely piled with trunks rolled in through a back door
and men pitched the trunks like toys here and there on
the counters, and officials came into view, and knots of
travellers gathered round trunks, and locks were turned
and lids were lifted, and the flash of linen showed in spots
on the drabness of the scene. Miss Ingate observed with
horror the complete undoing of a lady&#8217;s large trunk, and
the exposure to the world&#8217;s harsh gaze of the most intimate
possessions of that lady. Soon the counters were like a
fair. But no trunk belonging to Audrey or to Miss Ingate
was visible. They knew then, what they had both privately
suspected ever since Charing Cross, that their trunks would
be lost on the journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! My trunk!&#8221; cried Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Beneath a pile of other trunks on an incoming truck
she had espied her property. Audrey saw it, too. The
vision was magical. The trunk seemed like a piece of
home, a bit of Moze and of England. It drew affection
from them as though it had been an animal. They sped
towards it, forgetting their small baggage. Their <em>porteur</em>
leaped over the counter from behind and made signs for
a key. All Audrey&#8217;s trunks in turn joined Miss Ingate&#8217;s;
none was missing. And finally an official, small and fierce,
responded to the invocations of the <em>porteur</em> and established
himself at the counter in front of them. He put his hand
on Miss Ingate&#8217;s trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Op-en,&#8221; he said in English.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate opened her purse, and indicated to the
official by signs that she had no key for the trunk,
and she also cried loudly, so that he should comprehend:</p>

<p>&#8220;No key! ... Lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she looked awkwardly at Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been told they only want to open one trunk
when there&#8217;s a lot. Let him choose another one,&#8221; she
murmured archly.</p>

<p>But the official merely walked away, to deal with the
trunks of somebody else close by.</p>

<p>Audrey was cross.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ingate,&#8221; she said formally, &#8220;you had the key
when we started, because you showed it to me. You can&#8217;t
possibly have lost it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Winnie calmly and knowingly. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t lost it. But I&#8217;m not going to have the things in
my trunk thrown about for all these foreigners to see. It&#8217;s
simply disgraceful. They ought to have women officials
and private rooms at these places. And they would have,
if women had the vote. Let him open one of your trunks.
All your things are new.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <em>porteur</em> had meanwhile been discharging French
into Audrey&#8217;s other ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you must open it, Winnie,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so absurd!&#8221; There was a persuasive lightness
in her voice, but there was also command. For a moment
she was the perfect widow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <em>porteur</em> says we shall be here all night,&#8221; Audrey
persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know French?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I learnt French at school, Winnie,&#8221; said the perfect
widow. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand every word, but I can make
out the drift.&#8221; And Audrey went on translating the porter
according to her own wisdom. &#8220;He says there have been
dreadful scenes here before, when people have refused to
open their trunks, and the police have had to be called
in. He says the man won&#8217;t upset the things in your trunk
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate gazed into the distance, and privately smiled.
Audrey had never guessed that in Miss Ingate were such
depths of obstinate stupidity. She felt quite distinctly that
her understanding of human nature was increasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Look!&#8221; said Miss Ingate casually. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
those must be real Parisians!&#8221; Her offhandedness, her
inability to realise the situation, were exasperating to the
young widow. Audrey glanced where Miss Ingate had
pointed, and saw in the doorway of the custom-house two
women and a lad, all cloaked but all obviously in radiant
fancy dress, laughing together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they look French!&#8221; said Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Audrey tapped her foot on the asphalt floor, while people
whose luggage had been examined bumped strenuously
against her in the effort to depart. She was extremely
pessimistic; she knew she could do nothing with Miss
Ingate; and the thought of the vast, flaring, rumbling city
beyond the station intimidated her. The <em>porteur</em>, who had
gone away to collect their neglected small baggage, now
returned, and nudged her, pointing to the official who had
resumed his place behind the trunks. He was certainly
a fierce man, but he was a little man, and there was an
agreeable peculiarity in his eye.</p>

<p>Audrey, suddenly inspired and emboldened, faced him;
she shrugged her shoulders Gallically at Miss Ingate&#8217;s
trunk, and gave a sad, sweet, wistful smile, and then
put her hand with an exquisite inviting gesture on the
smallest of her own trunks. The act was a deliberate
exploitation of widowhood. The official fiercely shrugged
his shoulders and threw up his arms, and told the <em>porteur</em>
to open the small trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you they would,&#8221; said Miss Ingate negligently.</p>

<p>Audrey would have turned upon her and slain her had
she not been busy with the tremendous realisation of the
fact that by a glance and a gesture she had conquered the
customs official&mdash;a foreigner and a stranger. She wanted
to be alone and to think.</p>

<p>Just as the trunk was being relocked, Audrey heard
an American girlish voice behind her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you must be Miss Ingate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; Miss Ingate almost ecstatically admitted.</p>

<p>The trio in cloaked fancy dress were surrounding Miss
Ingate like a bodyguard.</p>

<h3>LIFE IN PARIS</h3>


<p>Miss Thompkins and Miss Nickall were a charm to
dissipate all the affrighting menace of the city beyond the
station. Miss Thompkins had fluffy red hair, with the
freckles which too often accompany red hair, and was
addressed as Tommy. Miss Nickall had fluffy grey hair,
with warm, loving eyes, and was addressed as Nick. The
age of either might have been anything from twenty-four
to forty. The one came from Wyoming, the other from
Arizona; and it was instantly clear that they were close
friends. They had driven up to the terminus before going
to a fancy-dress ball to be given that night in the studio
of Monsieur Dauphin, a famous French painter and a
delightful man. They had met Monsieur Dauphin on the
previous evening on the terrace of the Café de Versailles,
and Monsieur had said, in response to their suggestion,
that he would be enchanted and too much honoured if they
would bring their English friends to his little &#8220;leaping"&mdash;that
was, hop.</p>

<p>Also they had thought that it would be nice for the
travellers to be met at the terminus, especially as Miss
Ingate had been very particularly recommended to Miss
Thompkins by a whole group of people in London. It
was Miss Thompkins who had supplied the address of
reliable furnished rooms, and she and Nick would personally
introduce the ladies to their landlady, who was a
sweet creature.</p>

<p>Tommy and Nick and Miss Ingate were at once on
terms of cordial informality; but the Americans seemed to
be a little diffident before the companion. Their voices,
at the introduction, had reinforced the surprise of their
first glances. &#8220;Oh! <em>Mrs.</em> Moncreiff!&#8221; The slightest
insistence, no more, on the &#8220;Mrs."! Nothing said, but
evidently they had expected somebody else!</p>

<p>Then there was the boy, whom they called Musa. He
was dark, slim, with timorous great eyes, and attired in
red as a devil beneath his student&#8217;s cloak. He apologised
slowly in English for not being able to speak English.
He said he was very French, and Tommy and Nick smiled,
and he smiled back at them rather wistfully. When Tommy
and Nick had spoken with the chauffeurs in French he
interpreted their remarks. There were two motor-taxis,
one for the luggage.</p>

<p>Miss Thompkins accompanied the luggage; she insisted
on doing so. She could tell sinister tales of Paris cabmen,
and she even delayed the departure in order to explain
that once in the suburbs and in the pre-taxi days a cabman
had threatened to drive her and himself into the Seine
unless she would be his bride, and she saved herself by
promising to be his bride and telling him that she lived
in the Avenue de l&#8217;Opéra; as soon as the cab reached a
populous thoroughfare she opened the cab door and squealed
and was rescued; she had let the driver go free because
of his good taste.</p>

<p>As the procession whizzed through nocturnal streets,
some thunderous with traffic, others very quiet, but all
lined with lofty regular buildings, Audrey was penetrated
by the romance of this city where cabmen passionately and
to the point of suicide and murder adored their fares.
And she thought that perhaps, after all, Madame Piriac&#8217;s
impression of Paris might not be entirely misleading. Miss
Ingate and Nick talked easily, very charmed with one
another, both excited. Audrey said little, and the dark
youth said nothing. But once the dark youth murmured
shyly to Audrey in English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you play at ten-nis, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed a thoroughfare that twinkled and glittered
from end to end with moving sky-signs. Serpents pursued
burning serpents on the heights of that thoroughfare, invisible
hands wrote mystic words of warning and invitation,
and blazing kittens played with balls of incandescent wool.
Throngs of promenaders moved under theatrical trees that
waved their pale emerald against the velvet sky, and the
ground floor of every edifice was a glowing café, whose
tables, full of idle sippers and loungers, bulged out on to
the broad pavements.... The momentary vision was shut
off instantly as the taxis shot down the mouth of a dark
narrow street; but it had been long enough to make Audrey&#8217;s
heart throb.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; exclaimed Nick kindly. &#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s only
the <em>grand boulevard</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they crossed the sombre, lamp-reflecting Seine, and
soon afterwards the two taxis stopped at a vast black door
in a very wide street of serried palatial façades that were
continually shaken by the rushing tumult of electric cars.
Tommy jumped out and pushed a button, and the door
automatically split in two, disclosing a vast and dim tunnel.
Tommy ran within, and came out again with a coatless man
in a black-and-yellow striped waistcoat and a short white
apron. This man, Musa, and the two chauffeurs entered
swiftly into a complex altercation, which endured until
Audrey had paid the chauffeurs and all the trunks had been
transported behind the immense door and the door bangingly
shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vehy amusing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; whispered Miss Ingate
caustically to Audrey. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they dears?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Dubois&#8217;s establishment is on the third and
fourth floors,&#8221; said Nick.</p>

<p>They climbed a broad, curving, carpeted staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here,&#8221; said Audrey to Miss Ingate after scores
of stairs.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate, breathless, could only smile.</p>

<p>And Audrey profoundly felt that she was in Paris. The
mere shape of the doorknob by the side of a brass plate
lettered &#8220;Madame Dubois&#8221; told her that she was in an
exotic land.</p>

<p>And in the interior of Madame Dubois&#8217;s establishment
Tommy and Nick together drew apart the curtains, opened
the windows, and opened the shutters of a pleasantly stuffy
sitting-room. Everybody leaned out, and they saw the
superb thoroughfare, straight and interminable, and the
moving roofs of the tram-cars, and dwarfs on the pavements.
The night was mild and languorous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that!&#8221; Nick pointed to a blaze of electricity
to the left on the opposite side of the road. &#8220;That&#8217;s where
we shall take you to dine, after you&#8217;ve spruced yourselves up.
You needn&#8217;t bother about fancy dress. Monsieur Dauphin
always has stacks of kimonos&mdash;for his models, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the travellers spruced themselves up in different bedrooms,
Tommy chattered through one pair of double doors
ajar, and Nick through the other, and Musa strummed with
many mistakes on an antique Pleyel piano. And as Audrey
listened to the talk of these acquaintances, Tommy and Nick,
who in half an hour had put on the hue of her lifelong friends,
and as she heard the piano, and felt the vibration of cars far
beneath, she decided that she was still growing happier and
happier, and that life and the world were marvellous.</p>

<p>A little later they passed into the café-restaurant through
a throng of seated sippers who were spread around its portals
like a defence. The interior, low, and stretching backwards,
apparently endless, into the bowels of the building,
was swimming in the brightest light. At a raised semicircular
counter in the centre two women were enthroned,
plump, sedate, darkly dressed, and of middle age. To these
priestesses came a constant succession of waiters, in the
classic garb of waiters, bearing trays which they offered
to the gaze of the women, and afterwards throwing down
coins that rang on the marble of the counter. One of the
women wrote swiftly in a great tome. Both of them, while
performing their duties, glanced continually into every part
of the establishment, watching especially each departure and
each arrival.</p>

<p>At scores of tables were the most heterogeneous collection
of people that Audrey had ever seen; men and women,
girls and old men, even a few children with their mothers.
Liquids were of every colour, ices chromatic, and the scarlet
of lobster made a luscious contrast with the shaded tints of
salads. In the extreme background men were playing billiards
at three tables. Though nearly everybody was talking,
no one talked loudly, so that the resulting monotone of
conversation was a gentle drone, out of which shot up at
intervals the crash of crockery or a hoarse command. And
this drone combined itself with the glittering light, and with
the mild warmth that floated in waves through the open windows,
and with the red plush of the seats, and with the rosiness
of painted nymphs on the blue walls, and with the
complexions of women&#8217;s faces, and their hats and frocks,
and with the hues of the liquids&mdash;to produce a totality of
impression that made Audrey dizzy with ecstasy. This was
not the Paris set forth by Madame Piriac, but it was a wondrous
Paris, and in Audrey&#8217;s esteem not far removed from
heaven.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate, magnificently pale, followed Tommy and
Nick with ironic delight up the long passage between the
tables. Her eyes seemed to be saying: &#8220;I am overpowered,
and yet there is something in me that is not overpowered, and
by virtue of my kind-hearted derision I, from Essex, am
superior to you all!&#8221; Audrey, with glance downcast, followed
Miss Ingate, and Musa came last, sinuously. Nobody
looked up at them more than casually, but at intervals during
the passage Tommy and Nick nodded and smiled: &#8220;How
d&#8217;ye do? How d&#8217;ye do?&#8221; &#8220;<em>Bon soir,</em>&#8220; and answers were
given in American or French voices.</p>

<p>They came to rest near the billiard tables, and near an
aperture with a shelf where all the waiters congregated to
shout their orders. A grey-haired waiter, with the rapidity
and dexterity of a conjurer, laid a cloth over the marble
round which they sat, Audrey and Miss Ingate on the plush
bench, and Tommy and Nick, with Musa between them, on
chairs opposite. The waiter then discussed with them for
five minutes what they should eat, and he argued the problem
seriously, wisely, helpfully, as befitted. It was Audrey,
in full view of a buffet laden with shell-fish and fruit, who
first suggested lobster, and lobster was chosen, nothing but
lobster. Miss Ingate said that she was not a bit tired, and
that lobster was her dream. The sentiment was universal
at the table. When asked what she would drink, Audrey
was on the point of answering &#8220;lemonade.&#8221; But a doubt
about the propriety of everlasting lemonade for a widow with
much knowledge of the world, stopped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I vote we all have grenadines,&#8221; said Nick.</p>

<p>Grenadine was agreeable to Audrey&#8217;s ear, and everyone
concurred.</p>

<p>The ordering was always summarised and explained by
Musa in a few phrases which, to Audrey, sounded very different
from the French of Tommy and Nick. And she took
oath that she would instantly begin to learn to speak French,
not like Tommy and Nick, whose accent she cruelly despised,
but like Musa.</p>

<p>Then Tommy and Nick removed their cloaks, and sat displayed
as a geisha and a contadina, respectively. Musa had
already unmasked his devilry. The café was not in the least
disturbed by these gorgeous and strange apparitions. An
orchestra began to play. Lobster arrived, and high glasses
full of glinting green. Audrey ate and drank with gusto,
with innocence, with the intensest love of life. And she was
the most beautiful and touching sight in the café-restaurant.
Miss Ingate, grinning, caught her eye with joyous mockery.
&#8220;We are going it, aren&#8217;t we, Audrey?&#8221; shrieked Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Miss Thompkins and Miss Nickall began slowly to differentiate
themselves in Audrey&#8217;s mind. At first they were
merely two American girls&mdash;the first Audrey had met. They
were of about the same age&mdash;whatever that age might be&mdash;and
if they were not exactly of the same age, then Tommy
with red hair was older than Nick with grey hair. Indeed,
Nick took the earliest opportunity to remark that her hair
had turned grey at nineteen. They both had dreamy eyes
that looked through instead of looking at; they were both
hazy concerning matters of fact; they were both attached
like a couple of aunts to Musa, who nestled between them
like a cat between two cushions; they were both extraordinarily
friendly and hospitable; they both painted and both
had studios&mdash;in the same house; they both showed quite
a remarkable admiration and esteem for all their acquaintances;
and they both lacked interest in their complexions
and their hair.</p>

<p>The resemblance did not go very much farther. Tommy,
for all her praising of friends, was of a critical, curious, and
analytical disposition, and her greenish eyes were always at
work qualifying in a very subtle manner what her tongue
said, when her tongue was benevolent, as it often was.
Feminism and suffragism being the tie between the new
acquaintances, these subjects were the first material of conversation,
and an empress of militancy known to the world
as &#8220;Rosamund&#8221; having been mentioned, Miss Ingate said
with enthusiasm:</p>

<p>&#8220;She lives only for one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Tommy. &#8220;And if she got it, I guess no
one would be more disgusted than she herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy!&#8221; Nick lovingly protested.</p>

<p>Said Miss Ingate with a comprehending satiric grin:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you mean. I quite see. I quite see. You&#8217;re
right, Miss Thompkins. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey decided she would have to be very clever in
order to be equal to Tommy&#8217;s subtlety. Nick, on the other
hand, was not a bit subtle, except when she tried to imitate
Tommy. Nick was kindness, and sympathy, and vagueness.
You could see these admirable qualities in every curve of her
face and gleam of her eyes. She was very sympathetic, but
somewhat shocked when Audrey blurted out that she had not
come to Paris in order to paint.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are at least fifty painters in this café this very
minute,&#8221; said Tommy. And somehow it was just as if she
had said: &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t come to Paris to paint, what have
you come for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Musa paint, too?&#8221; asked Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh <em>no</em>!&#8221; Both his protectresses answered together,
pained. Tommy added: &#8220;Musa plays the violin&mdash;of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Musa blushed. Later, he murmured to Audrey
across the table, while Tommy was ordering a salad, that
there were tennis courts in the Luxembourg gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to paint,&#8221; Miss Ingate broke out. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
beginning to think I should like to paint again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Nick, enraptured:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you use my studio, if you will. I&#8217;d just love you
to, now! Where did you study?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was like this,&#8221; said Miss Ingate with satisfaction.
&#8220;It was a long time ago. I finished painting a
dog-kennel because the house-painter&#8217;s wife died and he had
to go to her funeral, and the dog didn&#8217;t like being kept waiting.
That gave me the idea. I went into water-colours, but
afterwards I went back to oils. Oils seemed more real. Then
I started on portraits, and I did a portrait of my Aunt Sarah
from memory. After she saw it she tore up her will, and
before I could get her into a good temper again she married
her third husband and she had to make a new will in favour
of him. So I found painting very expensive. Not that it
would have made any difference, I suppose, would it? After
that I went into miniatures. The same dog that I painted
the kennel for ate up the best miniature I ever did. It killed
him. I put a cross over his grave in the garden. All that
made me see what a fool I&#8217;d been, and I exchanged my painting
things for a lawn-mower, but it never turned out to be
any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear! You precious! You priceless!&#8221; cooed Nick.
&#8220;I shall fix up my second best easel for you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she just too lovely!&#8221; Tommy murmured aside to
Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I not much understand,&#8221; said Musa.</p>

<p>Tommy translated to him, haltingly, and Audrey was
moved to say, with energy:</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want most is to learn French, and I&#8217;m going
to begin to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick was kindly confusing and shaming Miss Ingate
with a short history and catechism of modern art, including
such names as Vuillard, Bonnard, Picasso, Signac, and
Matisse&mdash;all very eagerly poured out and all very unnerving
for Miss Ingate, whose directory of painting was practically
limited to the names of Raphael, Sir Joshua, Rembrandt,
Rubens, Gainsborough, Turner, Leighton, Millais, Gustave
Doré and Frank Dicksee. When, however, Nick referred
to Monsieur Dauphin, Miss Ingate was as it were washed
safely ashore and said with assurance: &#8220;Oh yes! Oh
yes! Oh yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy listened for a few moments, and then, leaning
across the table and lighting a cigarette, she said in an
intimate undertone to Audrey: &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t <em>mind</em>
coming to the ball to-night. We really didn&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She stopped. Her eyes, ferreting in Audrey&#8217;s black, completed
the communication.</p>

<p>Unnerved for the tenth of a second, Audrey recovered
and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I shall like it very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been up against life!&#8221; murmured Tommy in a
melting voice, gazing at her. &#8220;But how wonderful all experience
is, isn&#8217;t it. I once had a husband. We separated&mdash;at
least, he separated. But I know the feel of being a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey blushed deeply. She wanted to push away all
that sympathy, and she was exceedingly alarmed by the
revelation that Tommy was an initiate. The widow was
the merest schoolgirl once more. But her blush had saved
her from a chat in which she could not conceivably have
held her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me being so clumsy,&#8221; said Tommy contritely.
&#8220;Another time.&#8221; And she waved her cigarette to the waiter
in demand for the bill.</p>

<p>It was after the orchestra had finished a tango, and
while Tommy was examining the bill, that the first violin
and leader, in a magenta coat, approached the table, and
with a bow offered his violin deferentially to Musa. Many
heads turned to watch what would happen. But Musa only
shrugged his shoulders and with an exquisite gesture of
refusal signified that he had to leave. Whereupon the
magenta coat gracefully retired, starting a Hungarian
dance as he went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa is supposed to be the greatest violinist in Paris&mdash;perhaps
in the world,&#8221; Tommy whispered casually to
Audrey. &#8220;He used to play here, till Dauphin discovered
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey, overcome by this prodigious blow, trembled at
the contemplation of her blind stupidity.</p>

<p>Beyond question, Musa now looked extremely important,
vivid, masterful. She had been mistaking him for a nice,
ornamental, useless boy.</p>

<h3>FANCY DRESS</h3>


<p>Just as the café-restaurant had been an intensification of
ordinary life, so was the ball in Dauphin&#8217;s studio an intensification
of the café-restaurant. It had more colour, more
noise, more music, more heat, more varied kinds of people,
and, of course, far more riotous movement than the café-restaurant.
The only quality in which the café-restaurant
stood first was that of sustenance. Monsieur Dauphin had
not attempted to rival the café-restaurant in the matter of
food and drink. And that there was no general hope of
his doing so could be deduced from the fact that many
of the more experienced guests arrived with bottles, fruit,
sausages, and sandwiches of their own.</p>

<p>When Audrey and her friends entered the precincts of
the vast new white building in the Boulevard Raspail, upon
whose topmost floor Monsieur Dauphin painted the portraits
of the women of the French, British, and American plutocracies
and aristocracies, a lift full of gay-coloured figures
was just shooting upwards past the wrought-iron balustrades
of the gigantic staircase. Tommy and Nick stopped to speak
to a columbine who hovered between the pavement and the
threshold of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s the grenadine or the lobster,
or whether it&#8217;s Paris,&#8221; said Miss Ingate confidentially in the
interval; &#8220;but I can scarcely tell whether I&#8217;m standing on
my head or my heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the Americans rejoined them, the lift had returned
and ascended with another covey of fancy costumes, including
a man with a nose a foot long and a girl with bright
green hair, dressed as an acrobat. On its next journey the
lift held Tommy and Nick&#8217;s party, and it held no more.</p>

<p>When the party emerged from it, they were greeted with
a cheer, hoarse and half human, by a band of light amateur
mountebanks of both sexes who were huddled in a doorway.
Within a quarter of an hour Audrey and Miss Ingate, after
astounding struggles in a dressing-room in which Nick alone
saved their lives and reputations, appeared in Japanese disguise
according to promise, and nobody could tell whether
Audrey was maid, wife, or widow. She might have been a
creature created on the spot, for the celestial purpose of a
fancy-dress ball in Monsieur Dauphin&#8217;s studio.</p>

<p>The studio was very large and rather lofty. Its walls
had been painted by gifted pupils of Monsieur Dauphin
and by fellow-artists, with scenes of life according to
Catullus, Theocritus, Propertius, Martial, Petronius, and
other classical writers. It is not too much to say that the
walls of the studio constituted a complete novelty for Audrey
and Miss Ingate. Miss Ingate opened her mouth to say
something, but, saying nothing, forgot for a long time to
shut it again.</p>

<p>Chinese lanterns, electrically illuminated, were strung
across the studio at a convenient height so that athletic
dancers could prodigiously leap up and make them swing.
Beneath this incoherent but exciting radiance the guests
swayed and glided, in a joyous din, under the influence of
an orchestra of men snouted like pigs and raised on a dais.
In a corner was a spiral staircase leading to the flat roof
of the studio and a view of all Paris. Up and down this
corkscrew contending parties fought amiably for the right
of way.</p>

<p>Tommy and Nick began instantly to perform introductions
between Audrey and Miss Ingate and the other guests.
In a few moments Audrey had failed to catch the names of
a score and a half of people&mdash;many Americans, some French,
some Argentine, one or two English. They were all very
talented people, and, according to Miss Ingate, the most
characteristically French were invariably either Americans
or Argentines.</p>

<p>A telephone bell rang in the distance, and presently a
toreador stood on a chair and pierced the music with a
message of yells in French, and the room hugely guffawed
and cheered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the host?&#8221; Audrey asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the telephoning was about,&#8221; said Tommy,
speaking loudly against the hubbub. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t come yet.
He had to rush off this afternoon to do pastel portraits of two
Russian princesses at St. Germain, and he hasn&#8217;t got back
yet. The telephone was to say that he&#8217;s started.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then one of the introduced&mdash;it was a girl wearing a mask
&mdash;took Audrey by the waist and whirled her strongly away
and she was lost in the maze. Audrey&#8217;s first impulse was to
protest, but she said to herself: &#8220;Why protest? This is
what we&#8217;re here for.&#8221; And she gave herself up to the dance.
Her partner held her very firmly, somewhat bending over
her. Neither spoke. Gyrating in long curves, with the other
dancers swishing mysteriously about them like the dancers of
a dream, and the music as far off as another world, they
clung together in the rhythm and in the enchantment, until
the music ceased.... The strong girl threw Audrey carelessly
off, and walked away, breathing hard. And there was
something in the strong girl&#8217;s nonchalant and curt departure
which woke a chord in Audrey&#8217;s soul that had never been
wakened before. Audrey could scarcely credit that she was
on the same planet as Essex. She had many dances with
men whom she hoped and believed she had been introduced to
by Tommy, and no less than seventeen persons of either sex
told her in unusual English that they had heard she wanted
to learn French and that they would like to teach her; and
then she met Musa, the devil.</p>

<p>Musa, with an indolent and wistful smile, suggested the
roof. Audrey was now just one of the throng, and quite
unconscious of herself; she fought archly and gaily on the
spiral staircase exactly as she had seen others do, and at last
they were on the roof, and the silhouettes of other fantastic
figures and of cowled chimney pots stood out dark against the
vague yellow glow of the city beneath. While Musa was
pointing out the historic landmarks to her, she was thinking
how she could never again be the girl who had left Moze
on the previous morning. And yet Musa was so natural and
so direct that it was impossible to take him for anything but
a boy, and hence Audrey sank back into early girlhood,
talking spasmodically to Musa as she used in school days to
talk to the brother of her school friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will teach you French,&#8221; said Musa, unaware that he
had numerous predecessors in the offer. &#8220;But will you play
tennis with me in the gardens of the Luxembourg?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey said she would, and that she would buy a
racket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about all those artists Miss Nickall spoke of,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I must know about all the artists, and all the
musicians, and all the authors. I must know all about them
at once. I shan&#8217;t sleep until I know all their names and I
can talk French. I shan&#8217;t <em>sleep</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa began the catalogue. When a girl came and
chucked him under the chin, he angrily slapped her face.
Then, to avoid complications, they descended.</p>

<p>In the middle of the studio, wearing a silk hat, a morning
coat, striped trousers, yellow gloves, and boots with spats,
stood a smiling figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Voilà</em> Dauphin!&#8221; said Musa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa!&#8221; called Monsieur Dauphin, espying the youth on
the staircase. Then he made a gesture to the orchestra:
&#8220;Give him a violin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey stood by Musa while he played a dance that nobody
danced to, and when he had finished she was rather
ashamed, under the curtain of wild cheering, because with her
Essex incredulity she had not sufficiently believed in Musa&#8217;s
greatness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit your host to introduce himself,&#8221; said a voice
behind her, not in the correct English of a linguistic Frenchman,
but in utterly English English. She had now
descended to the floor of the studio.</p>

<p>Emile Dauphin raised his glossy hat, and then asked to
be allowed to put it on again, as the company had decided
that it was part of his costume. He had a delicious smile, at
once respectful and intimate. Audrey had read somewhere
that really great men were always simple and unaffected&mdash;indeed
that it was often impossible to guess from their
demeanour that, etc., etc.&mdash;and this experience of the first
celebrity with whom she had ever spoken (except Musa, who
was somehow only Musa) confirmed the statement, and confirmed
also her young instinctive belief that what is printed
must be true. She was beginning to feel the stealthy on-comings
of fatigue, and certainly she was very nervous, but
Monsieur Dauphin&#8217;s quite particularly sympathetic manner,
and her own sudden determination not to be a little blushing
fool gave her new power.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t express to you,&#8221; he said, moving towards the
dais and mesmerising her to keep by his side. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
express to you how sorry I was to be so late.&#8221; He made
the apology with lightness, but with sincerity. Audrey knew
how polite the French were. &#8220;But truly circumstances were
too much for me. Those two Russian princesses&mdash;they came
to me through a mutual friend, a dear old friend of mine,
very closely attached also to them. They leave to-morrow
morning by the St. Petersburg express, on which they have
engaged a special coach. What was I to do? I tried to
tear myself away earlier, but of course there were the portrait
sketches to finish, and no doubt you know the usage of the
best society in Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; murmured Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up on the dais, will you?&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;And
let us survey the scene together.&#8221;</p>

<p>They surveyed the scene together. The snouted band
was having supper on the floor in a corner, and many
of the guests also were seated on the floor. Miss Ingate,
intoxicated by the rapture of existence, and Miss
Thompkins were carefully examining the frescoes on
the walls. A young woman covered from head to foot with
gold tinsel was throwing chocolates into Musa&#8217;s mouth, or
as near to it as she could.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a splendid player Mr. Musa is!&#8221; Audrey inaugurated
her career as a woman of the world. &#8220;I doubt
if I have ever heard such violin playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you think so,&#8221; replied Monsieur Dauphin.
&#8220;Of course you know I&#8217;m very conceited about my
painting. Anybody will tell you so. But beneath all that
I&#8217;m not so sure. I often have the gravest doubts about
my work. But I never had any doubt that when I took
Musa out of the orchestra in the Café de Versailles I was
giving a genius to the world. And perhaps that&#8217;s how
I shall be remembered by posterity. And if it is I shall
be content.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never before had Audrey heard anybody connect himself
with posterity, and she was very much impressed. Monsieur
Dauphin was resigned and yet brave. By no means convinced
that posterity would do the right thing, he nevertheless
had no grudge against posterity.</p>

<p>Just then there was a sharp scream at the top of the
spiral staircase. With a smile that condoned the scream
and excused his flight, Monsieur Dauphin ran to the
staircase, and up it, and disappeared on to the roof.
Nobody seemed to be perturbed. Audrey was left alone
and conspicuous on the dais.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charming, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Miss Thompkins, arriving
with Miss Ingate in front of the flower-screened
platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he is!&#8221; answered Audrey with sincerity, leaning
downwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he told you all about the Russian princesses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Audrey, pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he would,&#8221; said Miss Thompkins, with a
peculiar intonation.</p>

<p>Audrey knew then that Miss Thompkins, having first
maliciously made sure that she was a ninny, was now
telling her to her face that she was a ninny.</p>

<p>Tommy continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I guess he told you he&#8217;d given Musa to the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I knew he would. Well, when he comes back
he&#8217;ll tell you that you must come to one of his <em>real</em>
entertainments here, and that this one is nothing. Then
he&#8217;ll tell you about all the nobs he knows in London. And
at last he&#8217;ll say that you have a strangely expressive face,
and he&#8217;d like to paint it and show the picture in the
Salon. But he won&#8217;t tell you it&#8217;ll cost you forty thousand
francs. So I&#8217;ll tell you that, because perhaps later on,
if you don&#8217;t know, you might find yourself making a noise
like a tenderfoot. You see, Miss Ingate hasn&#8217;t concealed
that you&#8217;re a lady millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Miss Ingate, glowing and yet
sarcastic. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to, because I was so
anxious to see if human nature in Paris is anything like
what it is in Essex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should you hide it, Winnie?&#8221; Audrey stoutly
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, au revoir,&#8221; Tommy murmured delicately, with
a very original gesture. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Monsieur Dauphin, having apparently established
peace on the roof, approached again, Audrey discreetly
examined his face and his demeanour, to see if she could
perceive in him any of the sinister things that Tommy
had implied. She was unable to make up her mind whether
she could or not. But in the end she decided that she
was as shrewd as anybody in the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been to my roof-garden, Mrs. Moncreiff?&#8221;
he asked in a persuasive voice, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>She said she had, and that she thought the roof was
heavenly.</p>

<p>Then from the corner of her eye she saw Miss Ingate
and Tommy sidling mischievously away, like conspirators
who have lighted a time fuse. She considered that Tommy,
with her red hair and freckles, and strange glances and
strange tones full of a naughty and malicious sweetness,
was even more peculiar than Miss Ingate. But she was
not intimidated by them nor by the illustrious Monsieur
Dauphin, so perfectly master of his faculties. Rather she
was exultant in the contagion of their malice. Once more
she felt as if she had ceased to be a girl a very long
time ago. And she was aware of agreeable and exciting
temptations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you taking a house in Paris?&#8221; inquired Monsieur
Dauphin.</p>

<p>Audrey answered primly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t decided. Should you advise me to do so?&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved a hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! It depends on the life you wish to lead. Who
knows&mdash;with a young woman who has all experience behind
her and all life before her! But I do hope I may see
you again. And I trust I may persuade you to come to
my studio again.&#8221; Audrey felt the thrill of drama as he
proceeded. &#8220;This is scarcely a night for you. I ought
to tell you that I give three entertainments during the
autumn. To-night is the first. It is for students and those
English and Americans who think they are seeing Paris
here. Then I give another for the political and dramatic
worlds. Each is secretly proud to meet the other. The
third I reserve to my friends. Some of my many friends
in London are good enough to come over specially for it.
It is on Christmas Eve. I do wish you would come to
that one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said, catching the diabolic glances of
Miss Ingate and Tommy, &#8220;I suppose you know almost
more people in London than in Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I count among my friends more than two-thirds
of the subscribers to Covent Garden Opera.... By the
way, do you happen to be connected with the Moncreiffs
of Suddon Wester? They have a charming house in Hyde
Park Terrace. But probably you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey burst out laughing. She laughed loud and
violently till the tears stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, at a loss, deprecatingly. &#8220;Perhaps
these Moncreiffs <em>are</em> rather weird.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only laughing,&#8221; she said in gasps, but with a
complete secret composure. &#8220;Because we had such an awful
quarrel with them last year. I couldn&#8217;t tell you the details.
They&#8217;re too shocking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a dubious smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know, dear young lady,&#8221; he recommenced after
a brief pause, &#8220;I should adore to paint a portrait of you
laughing. It would be very well hung in the Salon. Your
face is so strangely expressive. It is utterly different, in
expression, from any other face I ever saw&mdash;and I have
studied faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heedless of the general interest which she was arousing,
Audrey leaned on the rail of the screen of flowers, and
gave herself up afresh to laughter. Monsieur Dauphin
was decidedly puzzled. The affair might have ended in
hysteria and confusion had not Miss Ingate, with Nick
and Tommy, come hurrying up to the dais.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_11" id="chapter_11" />CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>A POLITICAL REFUGEE</h3>


<p>&#8220;Rosamund has come to my studio and wants to see me
at once. <em>She has sent for me.</em> Miss Ingate says she
shall go, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was these words in a highly emotionalised voice from
Miss Nickall that, like a vague murmured message of vast
events, drew the entire quartet away from the bright
inebriated scene created by Monsieur Dauphin.</p>

<p>The single word &#8220;Rosamund&#8221; sufficed to break one
mood and induce another in all bosoms save that of Audrey,
who was in a state of permanent joyous exultation that
she scarcely even attempted to control. The great militant
had a surname, but it was rarely used save by police
magistrates. Her Christian name alone was more impressive
than the myriad cognomens of queens and princesses. Miss
Nickall ran away home at once. Miss Thompkins was
left to deliver Miss Ingate and Audrey at Nick&#8217;s studio,
which, being in the Rue Delambre, was not far away.
And not the shedding of the kimono and the re-assumption
of European attire could affect Audrey&#8217;s spirits. Had
she been capable of regret in that hour, she would have
regretted the abandonment of the ball, where the refined,
spiritual, strange faces of the men, and the enigmatic
quality of the women, and the exceeding novelty of the
social code had begun to arouse in her sentiments of
approval and admiration. But she quitted the staggering
frolic without a sigh; for she carried within her a frolic
surpassing anything exterior or physical.</p>

<p>The immense flickering boulevard with its double
roadway stretched away to the horizon on either hand,
empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221; asked Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Tommy looked at her wrist-watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me! Don&#8217;t tell me!&#8221; cried Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might get a taxi in the Rue de Babylone,&#8221; Tommy
suggested. &#8220;Or shall we walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We <em>must</em> walk,&#8221; cried Audrey.</p>

<p>She knew the name of the street. In the distance she
could recognise the dying lights of the café-restaurant where
they had eaten. She felt already like an inhabitant of
the dreamed-of city. It was almost inconceivable to her
that she had been within it for only a few hours, and that
England lay less than a day behind her in the past, and
Moze less than two days. And Aguilar the morose, and
the shuttered rooms of Flank Hall, shot for an instant into
her mind and out again.</p>

<p>The other two women walked rather quickly, mesmerised
possibly by the magic of the illustrious Christian name,
and Audrey gave occasional schoolgirlish leaps by their
side. A little policeman appeared inquisitive from a by-street,
and Audrey tossed her head as if saying: &#8220;Pooh! I belong
here. All the mystery of this city is mine, and I am as
at home as in Moze Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as they surged through the echoing solitude of
the boulevard, and as they crossed the equally tremendous
boulevard that cut through it east and west, Tommy told
the story of Nick&#8217;s previous relations with Rosamund. Nick
had met Rosamund once before through her English chum,
Betty Burke, an art student who had ultimately sacrificed
art to the welfare of her sex, but who with Mrs. Burke
had shared rooms and studio with Nick for many months.
Tommy&#8217;s narrative was spotted with hardly perceptible
sarcasms concerning art, women, Betty Burke, Mrs. Burke,
and Nick; but she put no barb into Rosamund. And
when Miss Ingate, who had never met Rosamund, asked
what Rosamund amounted to in the esteem of Tommy,
Tommy evaded the question. Miss Ingate remembered,
however, what she had said in the café-restaurant.</p>

<p>Then they turned into the Rue Delambre, and Tommy
halted them in the deep obscurity in front of another of
those huge black doors which throughout Paris seemed
to guard the secrets of individual life. An automobile
was waiting close by. A little door in the huge one
clicked and yielded, and they climbed over a step into
black darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thompkins!&#8221; called Miss Thompkins loudly to the
black darkness, to reassure the drowsy concierge in his
hidden den, shutting the door with a bang behind them;
and, groping for the hands of the others, she dragged
them forward stumbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never have a match,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They blundered up tenebrous stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just passing my door,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;Nick&#8217;s
is higher up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a perpendicular slit of light showed itself&mdash;and
a portal slightly open could be distinguished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall quit here,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;You go right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t leaving us?&#8221; exclaimed Miss Ingate in
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go in,&#8221; Tommy persisted in a quiet satiric
tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave my door open below, and see you when
you come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could be heard descending.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I guess they&#8217;re here,&#8221; said a voice, Nick&#8217;s,
within, and the door was pulled wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;My legs are all of a tremble!&#8221; muttered Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Nick&#8217;s studio seemed larger than reality because of its
inadequate illumination. On a small paint-stained table
in the centre was an oil-lamp beneath a round shade that
had been decorated by some artist&#8217;s hand with a series
of reclining women in many colours. This lamp made a
moon in the midnight of the studio, but it was a moon
almost without rays; the shade seemed to imprison the
light, save that which escaped from its superior orifice.
Against the table stood a tall thin woman in black. Her
face was lit by the rays escaping upward; a pale, firm,
bland face, with rather prominent cheeks, loose grey hair
above, surmounted by a toque. The dress was dark, and
the only noticeable feature of it was that the sleeves were
finished in white linen; from these the hands emerged
calm and veined under the lampshade; in one of them
a pair of gloves were clasped. On the table lay a thin
mantle.</p>

<p>At the back of the studio there sat another woman, so
engloomed that no detail of her could be distinguished.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; the tall upright woman resumed as
soon as Miss Ingate and Audrey had been introduced.
&#8220;Betty Burke is in prison. She got six weeks this morning.
She may never come out again. Almost her last words from
the dock were that you, Miss Nickall, should be asked to go
to London to look after Mrs. Burke, and perhaps to take
Betty&#8217;s place in other ways. She said that her mother preferred
you to anybody else, and that she was sure you would
come. Shall you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The accents were very clear, the face was delicately
smiling, the little gestures had a quite tranquil quality.
Rosamund did not seem to care whether Miss Nickall obeyed
the summons or not. She did not seem to care about anything
whatever except her own manner of existing. She was
the centre of Paris, and Paris was naught but a circumference
for her. All phenomena beyond the individuality of the
woman were reduced to the irrelevant and the negligible. It
would have been absurd to mention to her costume balls.
The frost of her indifference would have wilted them into
nothingness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, I shall go,&#8221; Nick answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; was the implacable question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! By the first train,&#8221; said Nick eagerly. As she
approached the lamp, the gleam of the devotee could be seen
in her gaze. In one moment she had sacrificed Paris and art
and Tommy and herself, and had risen to the sacred ardour
of a vocation. Rosamund was well accustomed to watching
the process, and she gave not the least sign of satisfaction or
approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to tell you,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;that I came over
from London suddenly by the afternoon service in order to
escape arrest. I am now a political refugee. Things have
come to this pass. You will do well to leave by the first
train. That is why I decided to call here before going to
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Tommy?&#8221; asked Nick, appealing wildly to
Miss Ingate and Audrey. Upon being answered she said,
still more wildly: &#8220;I must see her. Can you&mdash;No, I&#8217;ll run
down myself.&#8221; In the doorway she turned round: &#8220;Mrs.
Moncreiff, would you and Miss Ingate like to have my studio
while I&#8217;m away? I should just love you to. There&#8217;s a very
nice bed over there behind the screen, and a fair sort of couch
over here. Do say you will! <em>Do</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! We will!&#8221; Miss Ingate replied at once, reassuringly,
as though in haste to grant the supreme request of
some condemned victim. And indeed Miss Nickall appeared
ready to burst into tears if she should be thwarted.</p>

<p>As soon as Nick had gone, Miss Ingate&#8217;s smiling face,
nervous, intimidated, audacious, sardonic, and good
humoured, moved out of the gloom nearer to Rosamund.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew I played the barrel organ all down Regent
Street?&#8221; she ventured, blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; murmured Rosamund, unmoved. &#8220;It was you
who played the barrel-organ? So it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;But I&#8217;m like you. I don&#8217;t
care passionately for prison. Eh! Eh! I&#8217;m not so vehy,
vehy fond of it. I don&#8217;t know Miss Burke, but what a pity
she has got six weeks, isn&#8217;t it? Still, I was vehy much
struck by what someone said to me to-day&mdash;that you&#8217;d be
vehy sorry if women <em>did</em> get the vote. I think I should be
sorry, too&mdash;you know what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; ejaculated Rosamund, with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;m not skidding,&#8221; said Miss Ingate still more
timidly, but also with a sardonic giggle, looking round into
the gloom. &#8220;I do skid sometimes, you know, and we&#8217;ve just
come away from a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mrs. Moncreiff, if I&#8217;ve got the name right, is she
with us, too?&#8221; asked Rosamund, miraculously urbane. And
added: &#8220;I hear she has wealth and is the mistress of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey jumped up, smiling, and lifting her veil. She
could not help smiling. The studio, the lamp, Rosamund
with her miraculous self-complacency, Nick with her soft,
mad eyes and wistful voice, the blundering ruthless Miss
Ingate, all seemed intensely absurd to her. Everything
seemed absurd except dancing and revelry and coloured lights
and strange disguises and sensuous contacts. She had the
most careless contempt, stiffened by a slight loathing, for
political movements and every melancholy effort to reform
the world. The world did not need reforming and did not
want to be reformed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t know my story,&#8221; Audrey began, not
realising how she would continue. &#8220;I am a widow. I made
an unhappy marriage. My husband on the day after our
wedding-day began to eat peas with his knife. In a week
I was forced to leave him. And a fortnight later I heard
that he was dead of blood-poisoning. He had cut his
mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with me? I have ruined myself.&#8221;
All her exultation had collapsed.</p>

<p>But Rosamund remarked gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a common story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a movement in the obscure corner
where sat the unnamed and unintroduced lady. This lady
rose and came towards the table. She was very elegant in
dress and manner, and she looked maturely young.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Piriac,&#8221; announced Rosamund.</p>

<p>Audrey recoiled.... Gazing hard at the face, she saw
in it a vague but undeniable resemblance to certain admired
photographs which had arrived at Moze from France.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me!&#8221; said Madame Piriac in English with a
strong French accent. &#8220;I shall like very much to hear the
details of this story of <em>petits pois</em>.&#8221; The tone of Madame
Piriac&#8217;s question was unexceptionable; it took account of
Audrey&#8217;s mourning attire, and of her youthfulness; but
Audrey could formulate no answer to it. Instead of speaking
she gave a touch to her veil, and it dropped before her
piquant, troubled, inscrutable face like a screen.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate said with noticeable calm, but also with
the air of a conspirator who sees danger to a most secret
machination:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Mrs. Moncreiff won&#8217;t care to go into details.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was neatly done. Madame Piriac brought the episode
to a close with a sympathetic smile and an apposite gesture.
And Audrey, safe behind her veil, glanced gratefully and
admiringly at Miss Ingate, who, taken quite unawares, had
been so surprisingly able thus to get her out of a scrape.
She felt very young and callow among these three women,
and the mere presence of Madame Piriac, of whom years
ago she had created for herself a wondrous image, put her
into a considerable flutter. On the whole she was ready to
believe that the actual Madame Piriac was quite equal to the
image of her founded on photographs and letters. She set
her teeth, and decided that Madame Piriac should not
learn her identity&mdash;yet! There was little risk of her discovering
it for herself, for no photograph of Audrey had
gone to Paris for a dozen years, and Miss Ingate&#8217;s loyalty
was absolute.</p>

<p>As Audrey sat down again, the illustrious Rosamund took
a chair near her, and it could not be doubted that the woman
had the mien and the carriage of a leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very rich, are you not?&#8221; asked Rosamund, in
a tone at once deferential and intimate, and she smiled very
attractively in the gloom. Impossible not to reckon with
that smile, as startling as it was seductive!</p>

<p>Evidently Nick had been communicative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I am,&#8221; murmured Audrey, like a child, and
feeling like a child. Yet at the same time she was asking
herself with fierce curiosity: &#8220;What has Madame Piriac got
to do with this woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear you have eight or ten thousand a year and can
do what you like with it. And you cannot be more than
twenty-three.... What a responsibility it must be for you!
You are a friend of Miss Ingate&#8217;s and therefore on our side.
Indeed, if a woman such as you were not on our side, I
wonder whom we <em>could</em> count on. Miss Ingate is, of course,
a subscriber to the Union&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a very little one,&#8221; cried Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Audrey had never felt so abashed since an ex-parlourmaid
at Flank Hall, who had left everything to join the Salvation
Army, had asked her once in the streets of Colchester
whether she had found salvation. She knew that she, if any
one, ought to subscribe to the Suffragette Union, and to
subscribe largely. For she was a convinced suffragette by
faith, because Miss Ingate was a convinced suffragette. If
Miss Ingate had been a Mormon, Audrey also would have
been a Mormon. And, although she hated to subscribe, she
knew also that if Rosamund demanded from her any subscription,
however large&mdash;even a thousand pounds&mdash;she would
not know how to refuse. She felt before Rosamund as
hundreds of women, and not a few men, had felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be leaving for Germany to-morrow,&#8221; Rosamund
proceeded. &#8220;I may not see you again&mdash;at any rate for many
weeks. May I write to London that you mean to support
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was giving herself up for lost, and not without
reason. She foreshadowed a future of steely self-sacrifice,
propaganda, hammers, riots, and prison; with no self-indulgence
in it, no fine clothes, no art, and no young men
save earnest young men. She saw herself in the iron clutch
of her own conscience and sense of duty. And she was
frightened. But at that moment Nick rushed into the room,
and the spell was broken. Nick considered that she had the
right to monopolise Rosamund, and she monopolised her.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate prudently gathered Audrey to her side, and
was off with her. Nick ran to kiss them, and told them that
Tommy was waiting for them in the other studio. They
groped downstairs, guided by a wisp of light from Tommy&#8217;s
studio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come up?&#8221; asked Miss Ingate of
Tommy in Tommy&#8217;s antechamber. &#8220;Have you and <em>she</em>
quarrelled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid of her. She&#8217;d
grab me if she had the least chance, and I don&#8217;t want to be
grabbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy was arranging to escort them home, and had
already got out on the landing, when Rosamund and Madame
Piriac, followed by Nick holding a candle aloft, came down
the stairs. A few words of explanation, a little innocent
blundering on the part of Nick, a polite suggestion by
Madame Piriac, and an imperious affirmative by Rosamund&mdash;and
the two strangers to Paris found themselves
in Madame Piriac&#8217;s waiting automobile on the way to
their rooms!</p>

<p>In the darkness of the car the four women could not distinguish
each other&#8217;s faces. But Rosamund&#8217;s voice was
audible in a monologue, and Miss Ingate trembled for
Audrey and for the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the most important political movement in the
history of the world,&#8221; Rosamund was saying, not at all in a
speechifying manner, but quite intimately and naturally.
&#8220;Everybody admits that, and that&#8217;s what makes it so extraordinarily
interesting, and that is why we have had such
magnificent help from women in the very highest positions
who wouldn&#8217;t dream of touching ordinary politics. It&#8217;s a
marvellous thing to be in the movement, if we can only
realise it. Don&#8217;t you think so, Mrs. Moncreiff?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey made no response. The other two sat silent.
Miss Ingate thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the girl going to do next? Surely she could
mumble something.&#8221;</p>

<p>The car curved and stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said Miss Ingate, delighted. &#8220;And
thank you so much. I suppose all we have to do is just
to push the bell and the door opens. Now Audrey, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey did not stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Mon Dieu!</em>&#8220; murmured Madame Piriac, &#8220;What has
she, little one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosamund said stiffly and curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;She is asleep.... It is very late. Four o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Excellent as was Audrey&#8217;s excuse for her lapse, Rosamund
was not at all pleased. That slumber was one of
Rosamund&#8217;s rare defeats.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_12" id="chapter_12" />CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>WIDOWHOOD IN THE STUDIO</h3>


<p>Audrey was in a white piqué coat and short skirt, with
pale blue blouse and pale blue hat&mdash;and at the extremity
blue stockings and white tennis shoes. She picked up a
tennis racket in its press, and prepared to leave the studio.
She had bought the coat, the skirt, the blouse, the hat, the
tennis shoes, the racket, the press, and practically all she
wore, visible and invisible, at that very convenient and immense
shop, the Bon Marché, whose only drawback was
that it was always full. Everybody in the Quarter, except
a few dolls not in earnest, bought everything at the Bon
Marché, because the Bon Marché was so comprehensive and
so reliable. If you desired a toothbrush, the Bon Marché
not only supplied it, but delivered it in a 30-h.p. motor-van
manned by two officials in uniform. And if you desired a
bedroom suite, a pair of corsets, a box of pastels, an anthracite
stove, or a new wallpaper, the Bon Marché would never
shake its head.</p>

<p>And Audrey was now of the Quarter. Many simple
sojourners in the Quarter tried to imply the Latin Quarter
when they said the Quarter. But the Quarter was only the
Montparnasse Quarter. Nevertheless, it sufficed. It had
its own boulevards, restaurants, cafés, concerts, theatres,
palaces, shops, gardens, museums, and churches. There
was no need to leave it, and if you were a proper amateur
of the Quarter, you never did leave it save to scoff at other
Quarters. Sometimes you fringed the Latin Quarter in the
big cafés of the Boulevard St. Michel, and sometimes you
strolled northwards as far as the Seine, and occasionally
even crossed the Seine in order to enter the Louvre, which
lined the other bank, but you did not go any farther. Why
should you?</p>

<p>Audrey had become so acclimatised to the Quarter that
Miss Nickall&#8217;s studio seemed her natural home. It was very
typically a woman&#8217;s studio of the Quarter. About thirty feet
each way and fourteen feet high, with certain irregularities
of shape, it was divided into corners. There were the two
bed-corners, which were lounge-corners during the day; the
afternoon-tea corner, with a piece or two of antique furniture
and some old silk hangings, where on high afternoons
tea was given to droves of visitors; and there was the culinary
corner, with spirit-lamps, gas-rings, kettles, and a bowl
or two over which you might spend a couple of arduous hours
in ineffectually whipping up a mayonnaise for an impromptu
lunch. Artistic operations were carried out in the middle of
the studio, not too far from the stove, which never went out
from November to May. A large mirror hung paramount
on one wall. The remaining spaces of the studio were filled
with old easels, canvases, old frames, old costumes and
multifarious other properties for pictures, trunks, lamps,
boards, tables, and bric-à-brac bought at the Ham-and-Old-Iron
Fair. There were a million objects in the studio, and
their situations had to be, and were, learnt off by heart.
The scene of the toilette was a small attached chamber.</p>

<p>The housekeeping combined the simplicity of the early
Christians with the efficient organising of the twentieth century.
It began at about half-past seven, when unseen but
heard beings left fresh rolls and the <em>New York Herald</em> or
the <em>Daily Mail</em> at the studio door. You made your own bed,
just as you cleaned your own boots or washed your own face.
The larder consisted of tins of coffee, tea, sugar, and cakes,
with an intermittent supply of butter and lemons. The infusing
of tea and coffee was practised in perfection. It
mattered not in the least whether toilette or breakfast came
first, but it was exceedingly important that the care of the
stove should precede both. Between ten and eleven the concierge&#8217;s
wife arrived with tools and utensils; she swept and
dusted under a considerable percentage of the million objects&mdash;and
the responsibilities of housekeeping were finished until
the next day, for afternoon tea, if it occurred, was a diversion
and not a toil.</p>

<p>A great expanse of twelve to fifteen hours lay in front
of you. It was not uncomfortably and unchangeably cut
into fixed portions by the incidence of lunch and dinner.
You ate when you felt inclined to eat, and nearly always at
restaurants where you met your acquaintances. Meals were
the least important happenings of the day. You had no
reliable watch, and you needed none, for you had no fixed
programme. You worked till you had had enough of work.
You went forth into the world exactly when the idea took
you. If you were bored, you found a friend and went to
sit in a café. You were ready for anything. The word
&#8220;rule&#8221; had been omitted from your dictionary. You retired
to bed when the still small voice within murmured
that there was naught else to do. You woke up in the
morning amid cups and saucers, lingerie, masterpieces, and
boots. And the next day was the same. All the days were
the same. Weeks passed with inexpressible rapidity, and
all things beyond the Quarter had the quality of vague
murmurings and noises behind the scenes.</p>

<p>May had come. Audrey and Miss Ingate had lived in
the studio for six months before they realised that they had
settled down there and that habits had been formed. Still,
they had accomplished something. Miss Ingate had gone
back into oils and was attending life classes, and Audrey,
by terrible application and by sitting daily at the feet of an
oldish lady in black, and by refusing to speak English between
breakfast and dinner, had acquired a good accent and
much fluency in the French tongue. Now, when she spoke
French, she thought in French, and she was extremely proud
of the achievement. Also she was acquainted with the names
and styles of all known modern painters from pointillistes to
cubistes, and, indeed, with the latest eccentricities in all the
arts. She could tell who was immortal, and she was fully
aware that there was no real painting in England. In brief,
she was perhaps more Parisian even than she had hoped. She
had absorbed Paris into her system. It was still not the Paris
of her early fancy; in particular, it lacked elegance; but it
richly satisfied her.</p>

<p>She had on this afternoon of young May an appointment
with a young man. And the appointment seemed quite
natural, causing no inward disturbance. Less than ever could
she understand her father&#8217;s ukases against young men and
against every form of self-indulgence. Now, when she had
the idea of doing a thing, she merely did it. Her instincts
were her only guide, and, though her instincts were often
highly complex, they seldom puzzled her. The old instinct
that the desire to do a thing was a sufficient reason against
doing it, had expired. For many weeks she had lived with
a secret fear that such unbridled conduct must lead to terrible
catastrophes, but as nothing happened this fear also
expired. She was constantly with young men, and often with
men not young; she liked it, but just as much she liked being
with women. She never had any difficulties with men. Miss
Thompkins insinuated at intervals that she flirted, but she
had the sharpest contempt for flirtation, and as a practice
put it on a level with embezzlement or arson. Miss Thompkins,
however, kept on insinuating. Audrey regarded herself
as decidedly wiser than Miss Thompkins. Her opinions
on vital matters changed almost weekly, but she was always
absolutely sure that the new opinion was final and incontrovertible.
Her scorn of the old English Audrey, though concealed,
was terrific.</p>

<p>And it is to be remembered that she was a widow. She was
never half a second late, now, in replying when addressed
as &#8220;Mrs. Moncreiff.&#8221; Frequently she thought that she in
fact was a widow. Widowhood was a very advantageous
state. It had a free pass to all affairs of interest. It opened
wide the door of the world. It recked nothing of girlish
codes. It abolished discussions concerning conventional propriety.
Its chief defect, for Audrey, was that if she met
another widow, or even a married woman, she had to take
heed lest she stumbled. Fortunately, neither widows nor
wives were very prevalent in the Quarter. And Audrey had
attained skill in the use of the state of widowhood. She told
no more infantile perilous tales about husbands who ate peas
with a knife. In her thankfulness that the tyrannic Rosamund
had gone to Germany, and that Madame Piriac had
vanished back into unknown Paris, Audrey was at pains to
take to heart the lesson of a semi-hysterical blunder.</p>

<p>She descended the dark, dusty oak stairs utterly content.
And at the door of the gloomy den of the concierge the concierge&#8217;s
wife was standing. She was a new wife, the young
mate of a middle-aged husband, and she had only been illuminating
the den (which was kitchen, parlour, and bedroom
in a space of ten feet by eight) for about a month. She was
plump and pretty, and also she was fair, which was unusual
for a Frenchwoman. She wore a striped frock and a little
black apron, and her yellow hair was waved with art. Audrey
offered her the key of the studio with a smile, and, as Audrey
expected, the concierge&#8217;s wife began to chatter. The concierge&#8217;s
wife loved to chatter with Anglo-Saxon tenants, and
she specially enjoyed chattering with Audrey, because of the
superior quality of Audrey&#8217;s French and of her tips. Audrey
listened, proud because she could understand so well and
answer so fluently.</p>

<p>The sun, which in May shone on the courtyard for about
forty minutes in the afternoon on clear days, caught these
two creatures in the same beam. They made a delicious
sight&mdash;Audrey dark, with her large forehead and negligible
nose, and the concierge&#8217;s wife rather doll-like in the regularity
of her features. They were delicious not only because
of their varied charm, but because they were so absurdly
wise and omniscient, and because they had come to settled
conclusions about every kind of worldly problem. Youth and
vitality equalised their ranks, and the fact that Audrey possessed
many ascertained ancestors, and a part of the earth&#8217;s
surface, and much money, and that the concierge&#8217;s wife possessed
nothing but herself and a few bits of furniture, was
not of the slightest importance.</p>

<p>The concierge&#8217;s wife, after curiosity concerning tennis,
grew confidential about herself, and more confidential. And
at last she lowered her tones, and with sparkling eyes
communicated information to Audrey in a voice that was
little more than a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! truly? I must go,&#8221; hastily said Audrey, blushing,
and off she ran, reduced in an instant to the schoolgirl.
Her departure was a retreat. These occasional discomfitures
made a faint blot on the excellence of being a
widow.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_13" id="chapter_13" />CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE SWOON</h3>


<p>In the north-east corner of the Luxembourg Gardens,
where the lawn-tennis courts were permitted by a public
authority which was strangely impartial and cosmopolitan
in the matter of games, Miss Ingate sat sketching a group
of statuary with the Rue de Vaugirard behind it. She
was sketching in the orthodox way, on the orthodox stool,
with the orthodox combined paint-box and easel, and the
orthodox police permit in the cover of the box.</p>

<p>The bright and warm weather was tonic; it accounted
for the whole temperament of Parisians. Under such a
sky, with such a delicate pricking vitalisation in the air,
it was impossible not to be Parisian. The trees, all
arranged in beautiful perspectives, were coming into leaf,
and through their screens could be seen everywhere children
shouting as they played at ball and top, and both kinds
of nurses, and scores of perambulators and mothers, and
a few couples dallying with their sensations, and old men
reading papers, and old women knitting and relating
anecdotes or entire histories. And nobody was curious
beyond his own group. The people were perfectly at home
in this grandiose setting of gardens and fountains and
grey palaces, with theatres, boulevards and the odour and
roar of motor-buses just beyond the palisades. And Miss
Ingate in the exciting sunshine gazed around with her
subdued Essex grin, as if saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s the most topsy-turvy
planet that I was ever on, and why am I, of all
people, trying to make this canvas look like a piece of
sculpture and a street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Ingate,&#8221; said tall red-haired Tommy, who
was standing over her. &#8220;Before you go any farther, do
look at the line of roofs and see how interesting it is;
it&#8217;s really full of interest. And you&#8217;ve simply not got on
speaking terms with it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more I have! No more I have!&#8221; cried Miss
Ingate, glancing round at Audrey, who was swinging her
racket. &#8220;Thank you, Tommy. I ought to have thought
of it for my own sake, because roofs are so much
easier than statues, and I must get an effect somewhere,
mustn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy winked at Audrey. But Tommy&#8217;s wink was
as naught to the great invisible wink of Miss Ingate,
the everlasting wink that derided the universe and the sun
himself.</p>

<p>Then Musa appeared, with paraphernalia, at the end
of a path. Accompanying him was a specimen of the
creature known on tennis lawns as &#8220;a fourth.&#8221; He was
almost nameless, tall, very young, with the seedlings of
a moustache and a space of nude calf between his knickerbockers
and his socks. He was very ceremonious, shy,
ungainly and blushful. He played a fair-to-middling game;
and nothing more need be said of him.</p>

<p>Musa by contrast was an accomplished man of the
world, and the fact that the fourth obviously regarded
him as a hero helped Musa to behave in a manner satisfactory
to himself in front of these English and American
women, so strange, so exotic, so kind, and so disconcerting.
Musa looked upon Britain as a romantic isle where people
died for love. And as for America, in his mind it was
as sinister, as wondrous, and as fatal as the Indies might
seem to a bank clerk in Bradford. He had need of every
moral assistance in this or any other social ordeal. For,
though he was still the greatest violinist in Paris, and
perhaps in the world, he could not yet prove this profound
truth by the only demonstration which the world
accepts.</p>

<p>If he played in studios he was idolised. If he played
at small concerts in unknown halls he was received with
rapture. But he was never lionised. The great concert
halls never saw him on their platforms; his name was
never in the newspapers; and hospitable personages never
fought together for his presence at their tables, even if
occasionally they invited him to perform for charity in
return for a glass of claret and a sandwich. Monsieur
Dauphin had attempted to force the invisible barriers for
him, but without success. All his admirers in the Quarter
stuck to it that he was in the rank of Kreisler and Ysaye;
at the same time they were annoyed with him inasmuch
as he did not force the world to acknowledge the prophetic
good taste of the Quarter. And Musa made mistakes.
He ought to have arrived at studios in a magnificent
automobile, and to have given superb and uproarious
repasts, and to have rendered innumerable women exquisitely
unhappy. Whereas he arrived by tube or bus, never
offered hospitality of any sort, and was like a cat with
women. Hence the attitude of the Quarter was patronising,
as if the Quarter had said: &#8220;Yes, he is the greatest
violinist in Paris and perhaps in the world; but that&#8217;s all,
and it isn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man and the boy made ready for the game
as for a gladiatorial display. Their frowning seriousness
proved that they had comprehended the true British idea
of sport. Musa came round the net to Audrey&#8217;s side, but
Audrey said in French:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Thompkins and I will play together. See, we
are going to beat you and Gustave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa retired. A few indifferent spectators had collected.
Gustave, the fourth, had to serve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play!&#8221; he muttered, in a thick and threatening voice,
whose depth was the measure of his nervousness.</p>

<p>He served a double fault to Tommy, and then a fault
to Audrey. The fourth ball he got over. Audrey played it.
The two males rushed with appalling force together on
the centre line in pursuit, and a terrible collision occurred.
Musa fell away from Gustave as from a wall. When he
arose out of the pebbly dust his right arm hung very
limp from the shoulder. No sooner had he risen than he
sank again, and the blood began to leave his face, and
his eyes closed. The fourth, having recovered from the
collision, knelt down by his side, and gazed earnestly at
him. Tommy and Audrey hurried towards the statuesque
group, and Audrey was thinking: &#8220;Why did I refuse to
let him play with me? If he had played with me there
would have been no accident.&#8221; She reproached herself
because she well knew that only out of the most absurd
contrariness had she repulsed Musa. Or was it that she
had repulsed him from fear of something that Tommy
might say or look?</p>

<p>In a few seconds, strongly drawn by this marvellous
piece of luck, promenaders were darting with joyous rapidity
from north, south, east and west to witness the tragedy.
There were nurses with coloured streamers six feet long,
lusty children, errand boys, lads, and sundry nondescript
men, some of whom carefully folded up their newspapers
as they hurried to the cynosure. They beheld the body
as though it were a corpse, and the corpse of an enemy;
they formulated and discussed theories of the event; they
examined minutely the rackets which had been thrown on
the ground. They were exercising the immemorial rights
of unmoved curiosity; they held themselves as indifferent
as gods, and the murmur of their impartial voices floated
soothingly over Musa, and the shadow of their active
profiles covered him from the sparkling sunshine. Somebody
mentioned policemen, in the plural, but none came.
All remarked in turn that the ladies were English, as
though that were a sufficient explanation of the whole
affair.</p>

<p>No one said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Musa, the greatest violinist in Paris and perhaps
in Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desperately Audrey stooped and seized Musa beneath
the armpits to lift him to a sitting position.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better leave him alone,&#8221; said Tommy, with a
kind of ironic warning and innuendo.</p>

<p>But Audrey still struggled with the mass, convinced that
she was showing initiative and firmness of character. The
fourth with fierce vigour began to aid her, and another
youth from the crowd was joining the enterprise when
Miss Ingate arrived from her stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop him, you silly little thing!&#8221; adjured Miss
Ingate. &#8220;Instead of lifting his head you ought to lift
his feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey stared uncertain for a moment, and then let
the mass subside. Whereupon Miss Ingate with all her
strength lifted both legs to the height of her waist, giving
Musa the appearance of a wheelless barrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to let the blood run <em>into</em> his head,&#8221; said
Miss Ingate with a self-conscious grin at the increasing
crowd. &#8220;People only faint because the blood leaves their
heads&mdash;that&#8217;s why they go pale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa&#8217;s cheeks showed a tinge of red. You could almost
see the precious blood being decanted by Miss Ingate out
of the man&#8217;s feet into his head. In a minute he opened
his eyes. Miss Ingate lowered the legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only the pain that made him feel queer,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>The episode was over, and the crowd very gradually
and reluctantly scattered, disappointed at the lack of a
fatal conclusion. Musa stood up, smiling apologetically,
and Audrey supported him by the left arm, for the right
could not be touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better take him home, Mrs. Moncreiff?&#8221;
Tommy suggested. &#8220;You can get a taxi here in the
Rue de Vaugirard.&#8221; She did not smile, but her green
eyes glinted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; said Audrey curtly.</p>

<p>And Tommy&#8217;s eyes glinted still more.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shall get a doctor,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;His arm
may be broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should,&#8221; Tommy concurred with gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if it is, <em>I</em> can&#8217;t set it,&#8221; said Miss Ingate
quizzically. &#8220;I was getting on so well with the high
lights on that statue. I&#8217;ll come along back to the studio
in about half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fourth, who had been hovering near like a criminal
magnetised by his crime, bounded off furiously at the
suggestion that he should stop a taxi at the entrance to
the gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he has broken his arm and he can never play
any more,&#8221; thought Audrey, astoundingly, as she and
the fourth helped pale Musa into the open taxi. &#8220;It will
just serve those two right.&#8221; She meant Miss Ingate and
Tommy.</p>

<p>No sooner did the taxi start than Musa began to cry.
He did not seem to care that he was in the midst of a
busy street, with a piquant widow by his side.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_14" id="chapter_14" />CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>MISS INGATE POINTS OUT THE DOOR</h3>


<p>&#8220;Why did you cry this afternoon, Musa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa made no reply.</p>

<p>Audrey was lighting the big lamp in the Moncreiff-Ingate
studio. It made exactly the same moon as it had
made on the night in the previous autumn when Audrey
had first seen it. She had brought Musa to the studio
because she did not care to take him to his own lodgings.
(As a fact, nobody that she knew, except Musa, had ever
seen Musa&#8217;s lodgings.) This was almost the first moment
they had had to themselves since the visit of the little
American doctor from the Rue Servandoni. The rumour
of Musa&#8217;s misfortune had spread through the Quarter like
the smell of a fire, and various persons of both sexes
had called to inspect, to sympathise, and to take tea,
which Audrey was continually making throughout the late
afternoon. Musa had had an egg for his tea, and more
than one girl had helped to spread the yolk and the
white on pieces of bread-and-butter, for the victim of
destiny had his right arm in a sling. Audrey had let
them do it, as a mother patronisingly lets her friends
amuse her baby.</p>

<p>In the end they had all gone; Tommy had enigmatically
looked in and gone, and Miss Ingate had gone to dine at
the favourite restaurant of the hour in the Rue Léopold
Robert. Audrey had refused to go, asserting that which
was not true; namely, that she had had an enormous
tea, including far too many <em>petits fours</em>. Miss Ingate in
departing had given a glance at her sketch (fixed on the
easel), and another at Audrey, and another at Musa, all
equally ironic and kindly.</p>

<p>Musa also had declined dinner, but he had done nothing
to indicate that he meant to leave. He sat mournful and
passive in a basket chair, his sling making a patch of
white in the gloom. The truth was that he suffered from
a disability not uncommon among certain natures: he did
not know how to go. He could arrive with ease, but he
was no expert at vanishing. Audrey was troubled. As
suited her age and condition, she was apt to feel the
responsibility of the whole universe. She knew that she
was responsible for Musa&#8217;s accident, and now she was
beginning to be aware that she was responsible for his
future as well. She was sure that he needed encouragement
and guidance. She pictured him with his fiddle under
his chin, masterful, confident, miraculous, throwing a spell
over everyone within earshot. But actually she saw him
listless and vanquished in the basket chair, and she
perceived that only a strongly influential and determined
woman, such as herself, could save him from disaster.
No man could do it. His tears had shaken her. She was
willing to make allowances for a foreigner, but she had
never seen a man cry before, and the spectacle was very
disturbing. It inspired her with a fear that even she
could not be the salvation of Musa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demanded something of you,&#8221; she said, after lowering
the wick of the lamp to exactly the right point, and
staring at it for a greater length of time than was
necessary or even seemly. She spoke French, and as she
listened to her French accent she heard that it was good.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am done for!&#8221; came the mournful voice of Musa
out of the obscurity behind the lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You are done for? But you know what the
doctor said. He said no bone was broken. Only a little
strain, and the pain from your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Admirable though
her French accent was, she could not think of the French
word for &#8220;funny-bone.&#8221; Indeed she had never learnt it.
So she said it in English. Musa knew not what she
meant, and thus a slight chasm was opened between them
which neither could bridge. She finished: &#8220;In one week
you are going to be able to play again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa shook his head.</p>

<p>Relieved as she was to discover that Musa had cried
because he was done for, and not because he was hurt,
she was still worried by his want of elasticity, of resiliency.
Nevertheless she was agreeably worried. The doctor had
disappointed her by his light optimism, but he could not
smile away Musa&#8217;s moral indisposition. The large vagueness
of the studio, the very faint twilight still showing
through the great window, the silence and intimacy, the
sounds of the French language, the gleam of the white
sling, all combined to permeate her with delicious melancholy.
And not for everlasting bliss would she have had Musa
strong, obstinate, and certain of success.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;It is for ever. A week
of practice lost is eternally lost. And on Wednesday one
had invited me to play at Foa&#8217;s. And I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Foa? Who is Foa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You do not know Foa? In order to succeed
it is necessary, it is essential, to play at Foa&#8217;s. That
alone gives the <em>cachet</em>. Dauphin told me last week. He
arranged it. After having played at Foa&#8217;s all is possible.
Dauphin was about to abandon me when he met Foa.
Now I am ruined. This afternoon after the tennis I was
going to Durand&#8217;s to get the new Caprice of Roussel&mdash;he
is an intimate friend of Foa. I should have studied
it in five days. They would have been ravished by the
attention .... But why talk I thus? No, I could not
have played Caprice to please them. I am cursed. I will
never again touch the violin, I swear it. What am I?
Do I not live on the money <em>lent</em> to me regularly by
Mademoiselle Thompkins and Mademoiselle Nickall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t, Musa?&#8221; Audrey burst out in English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; said Musa violently. &#8220;But last month,
from Mademoiselle Nickall&mdash;nothing! She is in London;
she forgets. It is better like that. Soon I shall be
playing in the Opéra orchestra, fourth desk, one hundred
francs a month. That will be the end. There can be
no other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of admiring the secret charity of Tommy and
Nick, which she had never suspected, Audrey was very
annoyed by it. She detested it and resented it. And
especially the charity of Miss Thompkins. She considered
that from a woman with eyes and innuendoes like Tommy&#8217;s
charity amounted to a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is extremely unsatisfactory,&#8221; she said, dropping on
to Miss Ingate&#8217;s sofa.</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken. Audrey tapped her foot.
Musa creaked in the basket chair. He avoided her eyes,
but occasionally she glared at him like a schoolmistress.
Then her gaze softened&mdash;he looked so ill, so helpless, so
hopeless. She wanted to light a cigarette for him, but she
was somehow bound to the sofa. She wanted him
to go&mdash;she hated the prospect of his going. He could not
possibly go, alone, to his solitary room. Who would
tend him, soothe him, put him to bed? He was an
infant....</p>

<p>Then, after a long while, Miss Ingate entered sharply.
Audrey coughed and sprang up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; ejaculated Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I shall just change my boots,&#8221; said Audrey,
smoothing out the short white skirt. And she disappeared
into the dressing-room that gave on to the studio.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, Miss Ingate went close up
to Musa&#8217;s chair. He had not moved.</p>

<p>She said, smiling, with the corners of her mouth well
down:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that door, young man?&#8221;</p>

<p>And she indicated the door.</p>

<p>When Audrey came back into the studio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey,&#8221; cried Miss Ingate shrilly. &#8220;What you been
doing to Musa? As soon as you went out he up vehy
quickly and ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this information Audrey was more obviously troubled
and dashed than Miss Ingate had ever seen her, in Paris.
She made no answer at all. Fortunately, lying on the table
in front of the mirror was a letter for Miss Ingate which had
arrived by the evening post. Audrey went for it, pretending
to search, and then handed it over with a casual gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if it was from Nick,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate, as she was putting on her spectacles,
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you weren&#8217;t hurt&mdash;me not coming with you and
Musa in the taxi from the gardens this afternoon, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Oh no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that I was so vehy interested in my sketch.
But to my mind there&#8217;s nothing more ridiculous than
several women all looking after one man. Miss Thompkins
thought so, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Did she?... What does Nick say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate had put the letter flat on the table in the full
glare of the lamp, and was leaning over it, her grey hair
brilliantly illuminated. Audrey kept in the shadow and in
the distance. Miss Ingate had a habit of reading to herself
under her breath. She read slowly, and turned pages over
with a deliberate movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Miss Ingate twisting her head sideways so
as to see Audrey standing like a ghost afar off. &#8220;Well, she
<em>has</em> been going it! She&#8217;s broken a window in Oxford
Street with a hammer; she had one night in the cells for
that. And she&#8217;d have had to go to prison altogether only
some unknown body paid the fine for her. She says:
&#8217;There are some mean persons in the world, and he was
one. I feel sure it was a man, and an American, too.
The owners of the shops are going to bring a law action
against me for the value of the plate-glass. It is such fun.
And our leaders are splendid and so in earnest. They say
we are doing a great historical work, and we are. The
London correspondent of the <em>New York Times</em> interviewed
me because I am American. I did not want to be interviewed,
but our instructions are&mdash;never to avoid publicity.
There is to be no more window breaking for the present.
Something new is being arranged. The hammer is so
heavy, and sometimes the first blow does not break the
window. The situation is <em>very</em> serious, and the Government
is at its wits&#8217; end. This we <em>know</em>. We have our
agents everywhere. All the most thoughtful people are
strongly in favour of votes for women; but of course some
of them are afraid of our methods. This only shows that
they have not learnt the lessons of history. I wonder that
you and dear Mrs. Moncreiff do not come and help. Many
women ask after you, and everybody at Kingsway is very
curious to know Mrs. Moncreiff. Since Mrs. Burke&#8217;s
death, Betty has taken rooms in this house, but perhaps
Tommy has told you this already. If so, excuse. Betty&#8217;s
health is very bad since they let her out last. With regard
to the rent, will you pay the next quarter direct to the
concierge yourselves? It will save so much trouble. I
must tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly Audrey moved up to the table and leaned over the
letter by Miss Ingate&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see!&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;Well, we must
show it to Tommy in the morning. &#8216;Not learnt the lessons
of history,&#8217; eh? I know who&#8217;s been talking to Nick. <em>I</em>
know as well as if I could hear them speaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we ought to go to London?&#8221; Audrey
demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Miss Ingate answered, with impartial irony on
her long upper lip. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Of course I played the
organ all the way down Regent Street. I feel very strongly
about votes for women, and once when I was helping in the
night and day vigil at the House of Commons and some
Ministers came out smoking their <em>cigahs</em> and asked us how
we liked it, I was vehy, vehy angry. However, the next
morning I had a cigarette myself and felt better. But I&#8217;m
not a professional reformer, like a lot of them are at Kingsway.
It isn&#8217;t my meat and drink. And I don&#8217;t think it
matters much whether we get the vote next year or in ten
years. I&#8217;m Winifred Ingate before I&#8217;m anything else. And
so long as I&#8217;m pretty comfortable no one&#8217;s going to make
me believe that the world&#8217;s coming to an end. I know one
thing&mdash;if we did get the vote it would take me all my time
to keep most of the women I know from, voting for something
silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;You&#8217;re very sensible sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always very sensible,&#8221; Winnie retorted, &#8220;until I
get nervous. Then I&#8217;m apt to skid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more words they transformed the studio, by a
few magical strokes, from a drawing-room into a bedroom.
Audrey, the last to retire, extinguished the lamp, and
tripped to her bed behind her screen. Only a few slight
movements disturbed the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie,&#8221; said Audrey suddenly. &#8220;I do believe you&#8217;re
one of those awful people who compromise. You&#8217;re always
right in the middle of the raft.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Ingate, being fast asleep, offered no answer.</p>

<h3>THE RIGHT BANK</h3>


<p>The next day, after a studio lunch which contained too
much starch and was deficient in nitrogen, Miss Ingate,
putting on her hat and jacket, said with a caustic gesture:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must be off to my life class. And much good
may it do me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The astonishing creature had apparently begun existence
again, and begun it on the plane of art, but this did not prevent
the observer within her from taking the same attitude
towards her second career as she had taken towards her first.
Nothing seemed more meet for Miss Ingate&#8217;s ironic contemplation
than the daily struggle for style and beauty in
the academies of the Quarter.</p>

<p>Audrey made no reply. The morning had been unusually
silent, giving considerable scope for Miss Ingate&#8217;s faculty
for leaving well alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you aren&#8217;t coming out?&#8221; added Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I went out a bit this morning. You know I have
my French lesson in twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate seized her apparatus and departed. The
instant she was alone Audrey began in haste to change into
all her best clothes, which were black, and which the
Quarter seldom saw. Fashionably arrayed, she sat down
and wrote a note to Madame Schmitt, her French instructress,
to say that she had been suddenly called away on
urgent business, and asking her nevertheless to count the
time as a lesson given. This done, she put her credit notes
and her cheque-book into her handbag, and, leaving the note
with the concierge&#8217;s wife, who bristled with interesting
suspicions, she vanished into Paris.</p>

<p>The weather was even more superb than on the previous
day. Paris glittered around her as she drove, slowly, in a
horse-taxi, to the Place de l&#8217;Opéra on the right bank,
where the <em>grand boulevard</em> meets the Avenue de l&#8217;Opéra and
the Rue de la Paix. Here was the very centre of the
fashionable and pleasure-ridden district which the Quarter
held in noble scorn. She had seen it before, because she had
started a banking account (under advice from Mr. Foulger),
and the establishment of her bankers was situate at the
corner of the Avenue de l&#8217;Opéra and the Rue de la Paix.
But she knew little of the district, and such trifling information
as she had acquired was tinged by the natural hostility
of a young woman who for over six months, with no compulsion
to do so, had toiled regularly and fiercely in the
pursuit of knowledge. She paid off the cab, and went to
test the soundness of her bankers. The place was full of
tourists, and in one department of it young men in cages,
who knew not the Quarter, were counting, and ladling, and
pinning together, and engorging, and dealing forth, the
currency and notes of all the great nations of the earth.
The spectacle was inspiring.</p>

<p>In half a year the restive but finally obedient Mr. Foulger
had sent three thousand pounds to Paris in the unpoetic
form of small oblong pieces of paper signed with his own
dull signature. Audrey desired to experience the thrill of
authentic money. She waited some time in front of a cage,
with her cheque-book open on the counter, until a young
man glanced at her interrogatively through the bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money have I got here, please?&#8221; she asked.
She ought to have said: &#8220;What is my balance, please?&#8221;
But nobody had taught her the sacred formula.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name?&#8221; said the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moze&mdash;Audrey Moze,&#8221; she answered, for she had not
dared to acquaint Mr. Foulger with her widowhood, and his
cheques were made out to herself.</p>

<p>The clerk vanished, and in a moment reappeared,
silently wrote something on a little form, and pushed it to
her under the grille. She read:</p>

<p>/*
&#8220;73,065 frs. 50c.&#8221;
*/</p>

<p>The fact was that in six months she had spent little more
than the amount which she had brought with her from
London. Having begun in simplicity, in simplicity she had
continued, partly because she had been too industrious and
too earnest for luxurious caprices, partly because she had
never been accustomed to anything else but simplicity, and
partly from wilfulness. It had pleased her to think that she
was piling tens of thousands upon tens of thousands&mdash;in
francs.</p>

<p>But in the night she had decided that the moment had
arrived for a change in the great campaign of seeing life
and tasting it.</p>

<p>She timorously drew a cheque for eleven thousand
francs, and asked for ten thousand in notes and a thousand
in gold. The clerk showed no trace of either astonishment
or alarm; but he insisted on her endorsing the cheque.
When she saw the gold, she changed half of it for ten notes
of fifty francs each.</p>

<p>Emerging with false but fairly plausible nonchalance
from the crowded establishment, where other clerks were
selling tickets to Palestine, Timbuctoo, Bagdad, Berlin, and
all the abodes of happiness in the world, she saw at the
newspaper kiosk opposite the little blue poster of an
English daily. It said: &#8220;More Suffragette Riots.&#8221; She
had a qualm, for her conscience was apt to be tyrannic, and
its empire over her had been strengthened by the long,
steady course of hard work which she had accomplished.
Miss Ingate&#8217;s arguments had not placated that conscience.
It had said to her in the night: &#8220;If ever there was a girl
who ought to assist heartily in the emancipation of women,
that girl is you, Audrey Moze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; she replied to her conscience, for she could
always confute it with a sharp word&mdash;for a time.</p>

<p>And she crossed to the <em>grand boulevard</em>, and turned
westward along the splendid, humming, roaring thoroughfare
gay with flags and gleaming with such plate-glass as
Nick the militant would have loved to shatter. Certainly
there was nothing like this street in the Quarter. The
Quarter could equal it neither in shops, nor in cafés, nor in
vehicles, nor in crowds. It was an exultant thoroughfare,
and Audrey caught its buoyancy, which could be distinctly
seen in the feather on her hat. At the end of it she passed
into the cool shade of a music-shop with the name
&#8220;Durand&#8221; on its façade. She had found the address, and
another one, in the telephone book at the Café de Versailles
that morning. It was an immense shop containing millions
of pieces of music for all instruments and all tastes. Yet
when she modestly asked for the Caprice for violin of
Roussel, the <em>morceau</em> was brought to her without the slightest
hesitation, together with the pianoforte accompaniment.
The price was twelve francs.</p>

<p>Her gloved hand closed round the slim roll with the
delicate firmness which was actuating all her proceedings on
that magnificent afternoon. She was determined to save
Musa not merely from himself, but from Miss Thompkins
and everybody. It was not that she was specially interested
in Musa. No! She was interested in a clean, neat job&mdash;that
was all. She had begun to take charge of Musa, and
she intended to carry the affair through. He had the ability
to succeed, and he should succeed. It would be ridiculous
for him not to succeed. From certain hints, and from a
deeply sagacious instinct, she had divined that money and
management were the only ingredients lacking to Musa&#8217;s
triumph. She could supply both these elements; and she
would. And her reward would be the pride of the workman
in his job.</p>

<p>Now her firmness hesitated. She retraced the boulevard
to the Place de l&#8217;Opéra, and then took the Rue de la Paix.
In the first shop on the left-hand side, next to her bankers,
she saw amid a dazzling collection of jewelled articles for
travellers and letter-writers and diary-keepers, a sublime
gold handbag, or, as the French say, hand-sack. Its clasp
was set with a sapphire. Impulse sent her gliding right
into the shop, with the words already on her lips: &#8220;How
much is that gold hand-sack in the window?&#8221; But when
she reached the hushed and shadowed interior, which was
furnished like a drawing-room with soft carpets and
tapestried chairs, she beheld dozens of gold hand-sacks
glinting like secret treasure in a cave; and she was
embarrassed by the number and variety of them. A well-dressed
and affable lady and gentleman, with a quite remarkable
similarity of prominent noses, welcomed her in general
terms, and seemed surprised, and even a little pained, when
she talked about buying and selling. She came out of the
shop with a gold hand-sack which had cost twelve hundred
francs, and all her money was in it.</p>

<p>Fortified by the impressive bauble, she walked along the
street to the Place Vendôme, where she descried in the distance
the glittering signs and arms of the Hôtel du Danube.
Then she walked up the opposite pavement of the Rue de la
Paix, and down again and up again until she had grasped
its significance.</p>

<p>It was a street of jewellery, perfumes, antiques, gloves,
hats, frocks, and furs. It was a street wherein the lily was
painted and gold was gilded. Every window was a miracle
of taste, refinement, and costliness. Every article in every
window was so dear that no article was ticketed with its
price, save a few wafer-like watches and jewelled rings that
bore tiny figures, such as 12,500 francs, 40,000 francs.
Despite her wealth, Audrey felt poor. The upper windows
of nearly all the great buildings were arrayed with plants
in full bloom. The roadway was covered with superb
automobiles, some of them nearly as long as trains. About
half of them stood in repose at the kerb, and Audrey as she
strolled could see through their panes of bevelled glass the
complex luxury within of toy dogs, clocks, writing-pads,
mirrors, powder boxes, parasols, and the lounging arrogance
of uniformed menials. At close intervals women passed
rapidly across the pavements to or from these automobiles.
If they were leaving a shop, the automobile sprang into life,
dogs, menials, and all, the door was opened, the woman
slipped in like a mechanical toy, the door banged, the
menial jumped, and with trumpet tones the entire machine
curved and swept away. The aspect of these women made
Audrey feel glad that she was wearing her best clothes, and
simultaneously made her feel that her best clothes were worse
than useless.</p>

<p>She saw an automobile shop with a card at the door:
&#8220;Town and touring cars for hire by day, week, or month.&#8221;
A gorgeous Mercédès, too spick, too span, altogether too
celestial for earthly use, occupied most of the shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Madame,&#8221; said a man in bad English.
For Audrey had misguided herself into the emporium. She
did not care to be addressed in her own tongue; she even
objected to the instant discovery of her nationality, of which
at the moment she was ashamed. And so it was with
frigidity that she inquired whether cars were to be hired.</p>

<p>The shopman hesitated. Audrey knew that she had
committed an indiscretion. It was impossible that cars
should be handed out thus unceremoniously to anybody who
had the fancy to enter the shop! Cars were naturally the
subject of negotiations and references.... And then the
shopman, espying the gold bag, and being by it and by the
English frigidity humbled to his proper station, fawned and
replied that he had cars for hire, and the best cars. Did the
lady want a large car or a small car? She wanted a large
car. Did she want a town or a touring car? She wanted a
town car, and by the week. When did she want it? She
wanted it at once&mdash;in half an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hire you a car in half an hour, with liveried
chauffeur,&#8221; said the shopman, after telephoning. &#8220;But he
cannot speak English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Ça m&#8217;est égal</em>,&#8221; answered Audrey with grim satisfaction.
&#8220;What kind of a car will it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercédès, Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>The price was eight hundred francs a week, inclusive.
As Audrey was paying for the first week the man murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;What address, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hôtel du Danube,&#8221; she answered like lightning&mdash;indeed
far quicker than thought. &#8220;But I shall call here for
the car. It must be waiting outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dispenser of cars bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you get a taxi for me?&#8221; Audrey suggested. &#8220;I
will leave this roll here and this bag,&#8221; producing her old
handbag which she had concealed under her coat. And she
thought: &#8220;All this is really very simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the other address which she had found in the
telephone book&mdash;a house in the Rue d&#8217;Aumale&mdash;she said to
an aged concierge:</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur Foa&mdash;which floor?&#8221;</p>

<p>A very dark, rather short and negligently dressed man
of nearly middle-age who was descending the staircase,
raised his hat with grave ceremony:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Madame. Foa&mdash;it is I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was not prepared for this encounter. She had
intended to compose her face and her speech while mounting
the staircase. She blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come from Musa&mdash;the violinist,&#8221; she began hesitatingly.
&#8220;You invited him to play at your flat on Friday
night, Monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur Foa gave a sudden enchanting smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madame. I hear much good of him from my
friend Dauphin, much good. And we long to hear him
play. It appears he is a great artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has had an accident,&#8221; said Audrey. Monsier Foa&#8217;s
face grew serious. &#8220;It is nothing&mdash;a few days. The elbow&mdash;a
trifle. He cannot play next Friday. But he will be
desolated if he may not play to you later. He has so few
friends.... I came.... I....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, every Friday we are at home, every Friday.
My wife will be ravished. I shall be ravished. Believe
me. Let him be reassured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur, you are too amiable. I shall tell Musa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa, he may have few friends&mdash;it is possible, Madame&mdash;but
he is nevertheless fortunate. Madame is English,
is it not so? My wife and I adore England and the
English. For us there is only England. If Madame would
do us the honour of coming when Musa plays.... My
wife will send an invitation, to the end of remaining within
the rules. You, Madame, and any of your friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur is too amiable, truly.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the end they were standing together on the pavement
by the waiting taxi. She gave him her card, and
breathed the words &#8220;Hôtel du Danube.&#8221; He was enchanted.
She offered her hand. He took it, raised it,
and kissed the back of it. Then he stood with his hat
off until she had passed from his sight.</p>

<p>Audrey was burning with excitement. She said to
herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have discovered Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the taxi turned again into the Rue de la Paix,
she thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;The car will not be waiting. It would be too lovely
if it were.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there the car was, huge, glistening, unreal, incredible.
And a chauffeur gloved and liveried in brown,
to match the car, stood by its side, and the shopman
was at the door, holding the Caprice of Roussel and the
old handbag ready in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is Madame,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The chauffeur saluted.</p>

<p>The car was closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Madame have the carriage open or closed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having paid the taxi-driver, Audrey entered the car,
and as she did so, she threw over her shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hôtel du Danube.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the chauffeur started the engine, the shopman
with brilliant smiles delivered the music and the bag. The
door clicked. Audrey noticed the clock, the rug, the powder-box,
the speaking-tube, and the mirror. She gazed, and
saw a face triumphant and delicious in the mirror. The
car began to glide forward. She leaned back against the
pale grey upholstery, but in her soul she was standing
and crying with a wild wave of the hand, to the whole
street:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a miracle!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment the gigantic car stopped in front of the
Hôtel du Danube. Two attendants rushed out in uniforms
of delicate blue. They did not touch their hats&mdash;they raised
them. Audrey descended and penetrated into the portico,
where a tall dandy saluted and inquired her will. She
wanted rooms; she wanted a flat? Certainly. They had
nothing but flats. A large flat on the ground-floor was at
her disposal absolutely. Two bedrooms, sitting-room,
bathroom. It had its own private entrance in the courtyard.
She inspected it. The suite was furnished in the
Empire style. Herself and maid? No. A friend! Well,
the maids could sleep upstairs. It could arrange itself. She
had no maid? Her friend had no maid? Ah! So much
the better. Sixty francs a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the dining-room?&#8221; demanded Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; said the dandy, shocked. &#8220;We have no
dining-room. All meals are specially cooked to order and
served in the private rooms. We have the reputation....&#8221;
He opened his arms and bowed.</p>

<p>Good! Good! She would return with her friend in one
hour or so.</p>

<p>&#8220;106 Rue Delambre,&#8221; she bade the chauffeur, after being
followed to the pavement by the dandy and a suite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rue de Londres?&#8221; said the chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Rue Delambre.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had to be looked out on the map, but the chauffeur,
trained to the hour, did not blench. However, when he
found the Rue Delambre, the success with which he
repudiated it was complete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie!&#8221; began Audrey in the studio, with assumed
indifference. Miss Ingate was at tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You are a swell. Where you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie! What do you say to going and living on the
right bank for a bit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;So that&#8217;s it, is it?
I&#8217;ve been ready to go for a long time. Of course you want
to go first thing to-morrow morning. I know you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;I want to go to-night.
Now! Pack the trunks quick. I&#8217;ve got the finest auto you
ever saw waiting at the door.&#8221;</p>

<h3>ROBES</h3>


<p>On the second following Friday evening, Audrey&#8217;s suite of
rooms at the Hôtel du Danube glowed in every corner with
pink-shaded electricity. According to what Audrey had
everywhere observed to be the French custom, there was in
this flat the minimum of corridor and the maximum of doors.
Each room communicated directly with all the other rooms.
The doors were open, and three women continually in a
feverish elation passed to and fro. Empire chairs and sofas
were covered with rich garments of every colour and form
and material, from the transparent blue silk <em>matinée</em> to the
dark heavy cloak of velvet ornamented with fur. The place
was in fact very like the showrooms of a cosmopolitan dressmaker
after a vast trying-on. Sundry cosmopolitan dressmakers
had contributed to the rich confusion. None had
hesitated for an instant to execute Audrey&#8217;s commands.
They had all been waiting, apparently since the beginning
of time, to serve her. All that district of Paris had been
thus waiting. The flat had been waiting, the automobile
had been waiting, the chauffeur had been waiting, and
purveyors of every sort. A word from her seemed to have
released them from an enchantment. For the most part
they were strange people, these magical attendants, never
mentioning money, but rather deprecating the sound of it,
and content to supply nothing but the finest productions of
their unquestionable genius. Still, Audrey reckoned that
she owed about twenty-five thousand francs to Paris.</p>

<p>The third woman was the maid, Elise. The hotel had
invented and delivered Elise, and thereafter seemed easier
in its mind. Elise was thirty years of age and not repellent
of aspect. On a black dress she wore the smallest white
muslin apron that either Audrey or Miss Ingate had ever
seen. She kept pins in her mouth, but in other respects
showed few eccentricities beyond an extreme excitability.
When at eight o&#8217;clock Mademoiselle&#8217;s new gown, promised
for seven, had not arrived, Elise begged permission to use
Madame&#8217;s salts. When the bell rang at eight-thirty, and a
lackey brought in an oval-shaped box with a long loop to it
of leathern strap, she only just managed not to kiss the
lackey. The rapid movement of Mademoiselle and Elise
with the contents of the box from the drawing-room into
Mademoiselle&#8217;s bedroom was the last rushing and swishing
that preceded a considerable peace.</p>

<p>Madame was absolutely ready, in her bedroom. In the
large mirror of the dark wardrobe she surveyed her
victoriously young face, the magnificent grey dress, the
coiffure, the jewels, the spangled shoes, the fan; and the
ensemble satisfied her. She was intensely and calmly happy.
No thought of the past nor of the future, nor of what was
going on in other parts of the earth&#8217;s surface could in the
slightest degree impair her happiness. She had done
nothing herself, she had neither earned money nor created
any of the objects which adorned her; nor was she capable
of doing the one or the other. Yet she felt proud as well as
happy, because she was young and superbly healthy, and not
unattractive. These were her high virtues. And her attitude
was so right that nobody would have disagreed with her.</p>

<p>Her left ear was listening for the sound, through the
unlatched window, of the arrival of the automobile with
Musa and his fiddle inside it.</p>

<p>Then the door leading from Mademoiselle&#8217;s bedroom
opened sharply, and Mademoiselle appeared, with her grey
hair, her pale shining forehead, her sardonic grin, and the
new dress of those Empire colours, magenta and green.
Elise stood behind, trembling with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Audrey began. But she heard the automobile,
and told Elise to run and be ready to open the front
door of the flat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather showy, isn&#8217;t it? Rather daring?&#8221; said Miss
Ingate, advancing self-consciously and self-deprecating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie,&#8221; answered Audrey. &#8220;It&#8217;s a nice question
between you and the Queen of Sheba.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Ingate beheld in the mirror the masterpiece
of an illustrious male dressmaker-a masterpiece in
which no touch of the last fashion was abated-and little
Essex Winnie grinning from within it.</p>

<p>She screamed. And forthwith putting her hands behind
her neck she began to unhook the corsage.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Winnie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m not going to wear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve nothing else to wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t come. What on earth shall you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say I shall go to bed. Or I might shoot myself.
But if you think that I&#8217;m going outside this room in this
dress, you&#8217;re a perfect simpleton, Audrey. I don&#8217;t mind
being a fool, but I won&#8217;t look one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey heard Musa enter the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She pulled the door to, keeping her hand on the knob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Winnie,&#8221; she said coldly, and swept into
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>As she and Musa left the pink rose-shaded flat, she heard
a burst of tears from Elise in the bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;21 Rue d&#8217;Aumale,&#8221; she curtly ordered the chauffeur,
who sat like a god obscurely in front of the illuminated
interior of the carriage. Musa&#8217;s violin case lay amid the
cushions therein.</p>

<p>The chauffeur approvingly touched his hat. The Rue
d&#8217;Aumale was a good street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what his surname is?&#8221; Audrey thought
curiously. &#8220;And whether he&#8217;s in love or married, and has
children.&#8221; She knew nothing of him save that his Christian
name was Michel.</p>

<p>She was taciturn and severe with Musa.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_17" id="chapter_17" />CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>SOIRÉE</h3>


<p>&#8220;Monsieur Foa&mdash;which floor?&#8221; Audrey asked once again
of the aged concierge in the Rue d&#8217;Aumale. This time she
got an answer. It was the fifth or top floor. Musa said
nothing, permitting himself to be taken about like a parcel,
though with a more graceful passivity. There was no lift,
but at each floor a cushioned seat for travellers to use and
a palm in a coloured pot in a niche for travellers to gaze
upon as they rested. The quality of the palms, however,
deteriorated floor by floor, and on the fourth and fifth floors
the niches were empty. A broad embroidered bell-pull,
twitched, gave rise to one clanging sound within the abode
of the Foas, and the clanging sound reacted upon a small
dog which yapped loudly and continued to yap until the
visitors had entered and the door been closed again.
Monsieur came out of a room into the small entrance-hall,
accompanied by a considerable noise of conversation. He
beamed his ravishment; he kissed hands; he helped with the
dark blue cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought Monsieur Musa in my car,&#8221; said Audrey.
&#8220;The weather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur Foa bowed low to Monsieur Musa, and
Monsieur Musa bowed low to Monsieur Foa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur, your accident I hope....&#8221;</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Cloak, overcoat, hat, stick&mdash;everything except the violin
case&mdash;were thrown pell-mell on to a piece of furniture in
the entrance-hall. Monsieur Foa, instead of being in evening
dress, was in exactly the same clothes as he had worn
at his first meeting with Audrey.</p>

<p>Madame Foa appeared in the doorway. She was a slim
blonde Italian of pure descent, whereas only the paternal
grandfather of Monsieur Foa had been Italian. Madame
Foa, who had called on Audrey at the Danube, exhibited the
same symptoms of pleasure as her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your friend? But your friend?&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>Audrey, being led gradually into the drawing-room, explained
that Miss Ingate had been prevented at the last
moment, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The distinction of Madame Foa&#8217;s simple dress had
reassured Audrey to a certain extent, but the size of the
drawing-room disconcerted her again. She had understood
that the house of the Foas was the real esoteric centre of
musical Paris, and she had prepared herself for vast and
luxurious salons, footmen, fountains of wine, rare flowers,
dandies, and the divine shoulders of operatic sopranos who
combined wit with the most seductive charm. The drawing-room
of the Foas was not as large as her own drawing-room
at the Danube. Still it was full, and double doors leading
to an unseen dining-room at right angles to its length produced
an illusion of space. Some of the men and some of
the women were elegant, and even very elegant; others
were not. Audrey instantly with her expert eye saw that
the pictures on the walls were of the last correctness, and a
few by illustrious painters. Here and there she could see
scrawled on them &#8220;à mon ami, André Foa.&#8221; Such
phenomena were balm. Everybody in the room was presented
to her, and with the greatest particularity, and the
host and hostess gazed on her as on an idol, a jewel, an
exquisite and startling discovery. Musa found two men he
knew. The conversation was resumed with energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Madame Foa in English, sitting down
intimately beside Audrey, with a loving gesture, &#8220;We will
have a little talk, you and I. I find our friend Madame
Piriac met you last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Yes,&#8221; murmured Audrey, fatally struck, but
admirably dissembling, for she was determined to achieve
the evening successfully. &#8220;Madame Piriac, will she come
to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not,&#8221; replied Madame Foa. &#8220;She would if she
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should so like to have seen her again,&#8221; said Audrey
eagerly. She was so relieved at Madame Piriac&#8217;s not
coming that she felt she could afford to be eager.</p>

<p>And Monsieur Foa, a little distance off, threw a sign into
the duologue, and called:</p>

<p>&#8220;You permit me? Your dress ... <em>Exquise! Exquise!</em>
And these pigs of French persist in saying that the English
lack taste!&#8221; He clapped his hand to his forehead in
despair of the French.</p>

<p>Then the clanging sound supervened, and the little fox-terrier
yapped, and Monsieur Foa went out, ejaculating
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and Madame Foa went into the doorway. Audrey
glanced round for Musa, but he was out of sight in the
dining-room. Several people turned at once and spoke to
her, including two composers who had probably composed
more impossibilities for amateur pianists than any other two
men who ever lived, and a musical critic with large dark
eyes and an Eastern air, who had come from the Opera very
sarcastic about the Opera. One of the composers asked the
critic whether he had not heard Musa play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the critic. &#8220;I heard him in the Ternes
Quarter&mdash;somewhere. He plays very agreeably. Madame,&#8221;
he addressed Audrey. &#8220;I was discussing with these gentlemen
whether it be not possible to define the principle of
beauty in music. Once it is defined, my trade will be much
simplified, you see. What say you?&#8221;</p>

<p>How could she discourse on the principle of beauty in
music when she had the whole weight of the evening on her
shoulders? Musa was the whole weight of the evening.
Would he succeed? She was his mother, his manager, his
creator. He was her handiwork. If he failed she would
have failed. That was her sole interest in him, but it was
an overwhelming interest. When would he be asked to
play? Useless for them to flatter her about her dress, to
treat her like a rarity, if they offered callous, careless, off-hand
remarks, such as &#8220;He plays very agreeably.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stammered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I only know what I like.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the composers jumped up excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Voilà</em> Madame has said the final word. You hear
me, the final word, the most profound. Argue as you will,
perfect the art of criticism to no matter what point, and you
will never get beyond the final word of Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>The critic shrugged his shoulders, and with a smile bowed
to the ravishing utterer of last words on the most baffling of
subjects. This fluttered person soon perceived that she had
been mistaken in supposing that the room was full. The
clanging sound kept recurring, the dog kept barking, and
new guests continually poured into the room, thereby proving
that it was not full. All comers were introduced to Audrey,
whose head was a dizzy riot of strange names. Then at last
a girl sang, and was applauded. Madame Foa played for
her. &#8220;Now,&#8221; thought Audrey, &#8220;they will ask Musa.&#8221;
Then one of the composers played the piano, his themes
punctuated by the clanging sound and by the dog. The
room was asphyxiating, but no one except Audrey seemed
to be inconvenienced. Then several guests rang in quick
succession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame!&#8221; the suave and ardent voice of Foa could
be heard in the entrance-hall. &#8220;And thou, Roussel ...
Ippolita, Ippolita!&#8221; he called to his wife. &#8220;It is Roussel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey did not turn her head. She could not. But presently
Roussel, in a blue suit with a wonderful flowing bow
of a black necktie in <em>crêpe de Chine</em>, was led before her. And
Musa was led before Roussel. Audrey, from nervousness, was
moved to relate the history of Musa&#8217;s accident to Roussel.</p>

<p>The moment had arrived. Roussel sat down to the piano.
Musa tuned his fiddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;From what appears,&#8221; murmured Monsieur Foa to nobody
in particular, with an ecstatic expectant smile on his
face, &#8220;this Musa is all that is most amazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, in the silence, the clanging sound was renewed,
and the fox-terrier reacted.</p>

<p>&#8220;André, my friend,&#8221; cried Madame Foa, skipping into
the hall. &#8220;Will you do me the pleasure of exterminating
this dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>Delicate osculatory explosions and pretty exclamations
in the hall! The hostess was encountering an old friend.
There was also a man&#8217;s deep English voice. Then a hush.
The man&#8217;s voice produced a very strange effect upon Audrey.
Roussel began to play. Musa held his bow aloft. Creeping
steps in the doorway made Audrey look round. A lady
smiled and bowed to her. It was Madame Piriac, resplendent
and serene.</p>

<p>Musa played the Caprice. Audrey did not hear him,
partly because the vision of Madame Piriac, and the man&#8217;s
deep voice, had extremely perturbed her, and partly because
she was so desperately anxious for Musa&#8217;s triumph. She
had decided that she could make his triumph here the
prelude to tremendous things. When he had finished she
held her breath....</p>

<p>The applause, after an instant, was sudden and extremely
cordial. Monsieur Foa loudly clapped, smiling at Audrey.
Roussel patted Musa on the back and chattered to him
fondly. On each side of her Audrey could catch murmured
exclamations of delight. Musa himself was certainly
pleased and happy.... He had played at Foa&#8217;s, where it
was absolutely essential to play if one intended to conquer
Paris and to prove one&#8217;s pretensions; and he had found
favour with this satiated and fastidious audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Ouf!&#8221;</em> sighed the musical critic Orientally lounging on
a chair. &#8220;André, has it occurred to you that we are
expiring for want of air?&#8221;</p>

<p>A window was opened, and a shiver went through the
assembly.</p>

<p>The clanging sounded again, but no dog, for the dog had
been exterminated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dauphin, my old pig!&#8221; Foa&#8217;s greeting from the
entrance floated into the drawing-room, and then a very impressed: &#8220;Mademoiselle&#8221; from Madame Foa.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Dauphin. &#8220;Musa has played? He
played well? So much the better. What did I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he entered the drawing-room with the satisfied air
of having fed Musa from infancy and also of having taught
him all he knew about the violin.</p>

<p>Madame Foa followed him, and with her was Miss Ingate,
gorgeous and blushing. The whole company was now on its
feet and moving about. Miss Ingate scuttered to Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Here I am. I came partly to
satisfy that hysterical Elise, and Monsieur Dauphin met me
on the stairs. But really I came because I&#8217;ve had another
letter from Miss Nickall. She&#8217;s been and got her arm
broken in a street row. I knew those policemen would do
it one day. I always said they would.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Audrey seemed not to be listening. With a side-long
gaze she saw Madame Piriac talking with a middle-aged
Englishman, whose back alone was visible to her.
Madame Piriac laughed and vanished out of sight into the
dining-room. The Englishman turned and met Audrey&#8217;s
glance.</p>

<p>Abruptly leaving Miss Ingate, Audrey walked straight
up to the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; she said in a low voice. &#8220;What is
your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gilman,&#8221; he answered, with a laugh. &#8220;I only this
instant recognised you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Gilman,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;will you oblige me
very much by not recognising me? I want us to be introduced.
I am most particularly anxious that no one should
know I&#8217;m the same girl who helped you to jump off your
yacht at Lousey Hard last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she moved quickly away.</p>

<h3>A DECISION</h3>


<p>The entire company was sitting or standing round the table
in the dining-room. It was a table at which eight might
have sat down to dinner with a fair amount of comfort; and
perhaps thirty-eight now were successfully claiming an
interest in it. Not at the end, but about a third of the way
down one side, Madame Foa brewed tea in a copper
receptacle over a spirit lamp. At the other extremity was a
battalion of glasses, some syphons and some lofty bottles.
Except for a border of teacups and glasses the rest of the
white expanse was empty, save that two silver biscuit boxes
and a silver cigarette box wandered up and down it according
to the needs of the community. Audrey was sitting next
to the Oriental musical critic, on her left, and on her right
she had a beautiful stout woman who could speak nothing
but Polish, but who expressed herself very clearly in the
language of smiles, nods, and shrugs; to Audrey she seemed
to be extremely romantic; the musical critic could converse
somewhat in Polish, and occasionally he talked across Audrey
to the Pole. Several other languages were flying about.
The subject of discussion was feminism, chiefly as practised
in England. It was Miss Ingate who had begun it; her
striking and peculiar appearance, and in particular her
frock, had given importance to her lightest word. People
who comprehended naught of English listened to her
entranced. The host, who was among these, stood behind
her in a state of ecstasy. Her pale forehead reddened; her
sardonic grin became deliciously self-conscious. &#8220;I know
I&#8217;m skidding,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m skidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she say? Skeed&mdash;skeed?&#8221; demanded the
host.</p>

<p>Audrey interpreted. Shouts of laughter!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! These English! These Englishwomen!&#8221; said
the host. &#8220;I adore them. I adore them all. They alone
exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s vehy serious!&#8221; protested Miss Ingate. &#8220;It&#8217;s vehy
serious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall go to London to-morrow, shan&#8217;t we,
Winnie?&#8221; said Audrey across the table to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Miss Ingate. &#8220;I think we ought. We&#8217;re
as free as birds. When the police have broken our arms we
can come back to Paris to recover. I shan&#8217;t feel comfortable
until I&#8217;ve been and had my arm broken&mdash;it&#8217;s vehy
serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she say? What is it that she says?&#8221; from
the host.</p>

<p>More interpretation. More laughter, but this time an
impressed laughter. And Audrey perceived that just as she
was regarding the Polish woman as romantic, so the whole
company was regarding herself and Miss Ingate as romantic.
She could feel the polite, curious eyes of twenty men upon
her; and her mind seemed to stiffen into a formidable
resolve. She grew conscious of the lifting of all depression,
all anxiety. Her conscience was at rest. She had been
thinking for more than a week past: &#8220;I ought to go to
London.&#8221; How often had she not said to herself: &#8220;If any
woman should be in this movement, I should be in this
movement. I am a coward as long as I stay here, dallying
my time away.&#8221; Now the decision was made, absolutely.</p>

<p>The Oriental musical critic turned to glance upward
behind his chair. Then he vacated it. The next instant
Madame Piriac was sitting in his place.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really going to London to-morrow, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madame, really!&#8221; answered Audrey firmly, without
the least hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I regret it! For this reason. I wished so much
to make your acquaintance. I mean&mdash;to know you a little.
You go perhaps in the afternoon? Could you not do me
the great pleasure of coming to lunch with me? I inhabit
the Quai Voltaire. It is all that is most convenient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was startled and suspicious, but she could not
deny the persuasiveness of the invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Madame!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know not at what hour
we go. But even if it should be in the afternoon there is
the packing&mdash;you know&mdash;in a word....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; Madame Piriac proceeded, bending even more
intimately towards her. &#8220;Be very, very kind. Come to see
me to-night. Come in my car. I will see that you reach
the Rue Delambre afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Madame, we are at the Hôtel du Danube. I have
my own car. You are very amiable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac was a little taken aback.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better,&#8221; she said, in a new tone. &#8220;The
Hôtel du Danube is nearer still. But come in my car.
Mademoiselle Ingate can return in yours. Do not desolate
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she know who I am?&#8221; thought Audrey, and
then: &#8220;What do I care if she does?&#8221;</p>

<p>And she said aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame, it is I who would be desolated to deprive
myself of this pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>A considerable period elapsed before they could leave,
because of the complex discussion concerning feminism
which was delicately raging round the edge of the table.
The animation was acute, but it was purely intellectual.
The guests discussed the psychology of English suffragettes,
sympathetically, admiringly; they were even wonderstruck;
yet they might have been discussing the psychology of the
ancient Babylonians, so perfect was their detachment, so
completely unclouded by any prejudice was their desire to
reach the truth. Many of the things which they imperturbably
and politely said made Audrey feel glad that she
was a widow. Had she not been a widow, possibly they
would not have been uttered.</p>

<p>And when Madame Piriac and Audrey did rise to go,
both host and hostess began to upbraid. The host, indeed,
barred the doorway with his urbane figure. They were not
kind, they were not true friends, to leave so soon. The
morrow had no sort of importance. The hour was scarcely
one o&#8217;clock. Other guests were expected.... Madame
Piriac alone knew how to handle the situation; she appealed
privately to Madame Foa. Having appealed to Madame
Foa, she disappeared with Madame Foa, and could not be
found when Audrey and Miss Ingate were ready to leave.
While these two waited in the antechamber, Monsieur Foa
said suddenly in a confidential tone to Audrey:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is charming, Musa, quite charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you like his playing?&#8221; Audrey demanded boldly.</p>

<p>She could not understand why it should be necessary for
a violinist to play and to succeed at this house before he could
capture Paris. She was delighted excessively with the
home, but positively it bore no resemblance to what she had
anticipated; nor did it seem to her to possess any of the
attributes of influence; for one of her basic ideas about the
world was that influential people must be dull and formal,
moving about with deliberation in sombrely magnificent
interiors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monsieur Foa. &#8220;I like it. He plays
admirably.&#8221; And he spoke sincerely. Audrey, however,
was a little disappointed because Monsieur Foa did not
assert that Musa was the most marvellous genius he had
ever listened to.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very, very content to have heard him,&#8221; said
Monsieur Foa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he will succeed in Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Madame! There is the Press. There are the
snobs.... In fine....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose if he had money?&#8221; Audrey murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Madame! In Paris, if one has money, one has
everything. Paris&mdash;it is not London, where to succeed one
must be truly successful. But he is a player very highly
accomplished. It is miraculous that he should have played
so long in a café&mdash;Dauphin told me the history.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa appeared, and after him Madame Piriac. More
appeals, more reproaches, more asseverations that friends
who left so early as one o&#8217;clock in the morning were not
friends&mdash;and the host at length consented to open the door.
At that very instant the bell clanged. Another guest had
arrived.</p>

<p>When, after the long descent of the stairs (which, however,
unlike the stairs of the Rue Delambre, were lighted),
Audrey saw seven automobiles in the street, she veered again
towards the possibility that the Foas might after all be
influential. Musa and Mr. Gilman, the yachtsman, had
left with the women. Audrey told Miss Ingate to drive
Musa home. She said not a word to him about her
departure the next afternoon, and he made no reference to
it. As the most imposing automobile moved splendidly
away, Mr. Gilman held open the door of Madame Piriac&#8217;s
vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman sat down opposite to the women. In the
enclosed space the rumour of his heavy breathing was
noticeable. Madame Piriac began to speak in English&mdash;her
own English&mdash;with a unique accent that Audrey at once
loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;You commence soon the yachting, my oncle?&#8221; said
she, and turning to Audrey: &#8220;Mistair Gilman is no oncle
to me. But he is a great friend of my husband. I call
always him oncle. Do not I, oncle? Mistair Gilman lives
only for the yachting. Every year in May we lose him, till
September.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>Her heart was apprehensively beating. She even suspected
for an instant that both of them knew who she was,
and that Mr. Gilman, before she had addressed him in the
drawing-room, had already related to Madame Piriac the
episode of Mozewater. Then she said to herself that the
idea was absurd; and lastly, repeating within her breast
that she didn&#8217;t care, she became desperately bold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should love to buy a yacht,&#8221; she said, after a pause.
&#8220;We used to live far inland and I know nothing of the sea;
in fact I scarcely saw it till I crossed the Channel, but I
have always dreamed about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come and have a look at my new yacht, Mrs.
Moncreiff,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman in his solemn, thick voice. &#8220;I
always say that no yacht is herself without ladies on board,
a yacht being feminine, you see.&#8221; He gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! My oncle!&#8221; Madame Piriac broke in. &#8220;I see
in that no reason. If a yacht was masculine then I could
see the reason in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not one of my happiest efforts,&#8221; said Mf.
Gilman with resignation. &#8220;I am a dull man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Madame Piriac protested. &#8220;You are a dear.
But why have you said nothing to-night at the Foas in the
great discussion about feminism? Not one word have you
said!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman.
&#8220;Either everybody is mad, or I am mad. I dare say I am
mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Madame Piriac. &#8220;I said not much myself,
but I enjoyed it. It was better than the music, music, which
they talk always there. People talk too much shops in
these days. It is out-to-place and done over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean overdone?&#8221; asked Mr. Gilman mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, overdone, if you like better that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean shop, Hortense?&#8221; asked Mr. Gilman
further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shop, shop! The English is impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>The automobile crossed the Seine and arrived in the
deserted Quai Voltaire.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_19" id="chapter_19" />CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE BOUDOIR</h3>


<p>In the setting of her own boudoir Madame Piriac equalled,
and in some ways surpassed, the finest pictures which
Audrey had imagined of her. Her evening dress made
Audrey doubt whether after all her own was the genuine
triumph which she had supposed; in Madame Piriac&#8217;s
boudoir, and close by Madame Piriac, it had disconcertingly
the air of being an ingenious but unconvincing imitation of
the real thing.</p>

<p>But Madame Piriac&#8217;s dress had the advantage of being
worn with the highest skill and assurance; Madame Piriac
knew what the least fold of her dress was doing, in the way
of effect, on the floor behind her back. And Madame
Piriac was mistress, not only of her dress, but of herself
and all her faculties. A handsome woman, rather more than
slim, but not plump, she had an expression of confidence, of
knowing exactly what she was about, of foreseeing all her
effects, which Audrey envied more than she had ever envied
anything.</p>

<p>As soon as Audrey came into the room she had said to
herself: &#8220;I will have a boudoir like this.&#8221; It was an
interior in which every piece of furniture was loaded with
objects personal to its owner. So many signed photographs,
so much remarkable bric-à-brac, so many intimate
contrivances of ornamental comfort, Audrey had never
before seen within four walls. The chandelier, comprising
ten thousand crystals, sparkled down upon a
complex aggregate of richness overwhelming to everybody
except Madame Piriac, who subdued it, understood it, and
had the key to it. Audrey wondered how many servants
took how many hours to dust the room. She was sure,
however, that whatever the number of servants required,
Madame Piriac managed them all to perfection. She longed
violently to be as old as Madame Piriac, whom she
assessed at twenty-nine and a half, and to be French, and to
know all about everything in life as Madame Piriac did.
Yet at the same time she was extremely determined to be
Audrey, and not to be intimidated by Madame Piriac or by
anyone.</p>

<p>Just as they were beginning to suck iced lemonade up
straws&mdash;a delightful caprice of Madame Piriac&#8217;s, well suited
to catch Audrey&#8217;s taste&mdash;the door opened softly, and a tall,
very dark, bearded man, appreciably older than Madame
Piriac, entered with a kind of soft energy, and Mr. Gilman
followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! My friend!&#8221; murmured Madame Piriac. &#8220;You
give me pleasure. This is Madame Moncreiff, of whom I
have spoken to you. Madame&mdash;my husband. We have just
come from the Foas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur Piriac bent over Audrey&#8217;s hand, and smiled
with vivacity, and they talked a little of the evening, carelessly,
as though time existed not. And then Monsieur
Piriac said to his wife:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear friend. I have to work with this old Gilman.
We shall therefore ask you to excuse us. Till to-morrow,
then. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, my friend. Do not do harm to yourself.
Good night, my oncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur Piriac saluted with formality but with sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; thought Audrey, as the men went away. &#8220;I
should want to marry exactly him if I did want to marry.
He doesn&#8217;t interfere; he isn&#8217;t curious; he doesn&#8217;t want to
know. He leaves her alone. She leaves him alone. How
clever they are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband is now chief of the Cabinet of the Foreign
Minister,&#8221; said Madame Piriac with modest pride. &#8220;They
kill themselves, you know, in that office&mdash;especially in these
times. But I watch. And I tell Monsieur Gilman to watch....
How nice you are when you sit in a chair like that!
Only Englishwomen know how to use an easy chair....
To say nothing of the frock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Piriac,&#8221; Audrey brusquely demanded with an
expression of ingenuous curiosity. &#8220;Why did you bring me
here?&#8221; It was the cry of an animal at once rash and
rather desperate, determined to unmask all the secret
dangers that might be threatening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I much desired to see you,&#8221; Madame Piriac answered
very smoothly, &#8220;in order to apologise to you for my
indiscreet question on the night when we first met. Your
fairy tale about your late husband was a very proper reply to
the attitude of Madame Rosamund&mdash;as you all call her. It
was very clever&mdash;so clever that I myself did not appreciate
it until after I had spoken. Ever since that moment I have
wanted to explain, to know you more. Also your pretence
of going to sleep in the automobile showed what in a woman
I call distinguished talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Madame, I assure you that I really was asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. The fact proves that your
instinct for the right thing is quite exceptional. It is not
that I would criticise Madame Rosamund, who has genius.
Nevertheless her genius causes her to commit errors of
which others would be incapable.... So she has captured
you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captured me!&#8221; Audrey protested&mdash;and she was
made stronger by the flattering reference to her distinguished
talent. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen her from that day to
this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But she has captured you. You are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To London, to take part in these riots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t have anything to do with riots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Within a month you will have been in a riot, Madame ...
and I shall regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And even if I am, Madame! You are a friend of
Rosamund&#8217;s. You must be in sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In sympathy with what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With&mdash;with all this suffragism, feminism. I am anyway!&#8221;
Audrey sat up straight. &#8220;It&#8217;s horrible that women
don&#8217;t have the Vote. And it&#8217;s horrible the things they have
to suffer in order to get it. But they <em>will</em> get it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say &#8216;they&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean &#8216;we.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing you meant &#8216;they,&#8217; after all? And you did,
Madame. Let me tell you. You ask me if I sympathise
with suffragism. You might as well ask me if I sympathise
with a storm or with an earthquake, or with a river running
to the sea. Perhaps I do. But perhaps I do not. That
has no importance. Feminism is a natural phenomenon; it
was unavoidable. You Englishwomen will get your vote.
Even we in France will get it one day. It cannot be denied....
Sympathy is not required. But let us suppose that all
women joined the struggle. What would happen to women?
What would happen to the world? Just as nunneries were
a necessity of other ages, so even in this age women must
meditate. Far more than men they need to understand
themselves. Until they understand themselves how can they
understand men? The function of women is to understand.
Their function is also to preserve. All the beautiful and
luxurious things in the world are in the custody of women.
Men would never of themselves keep a tradition. If there is
anything on earth worth keeping, women must keep it.
And the tradition will be lost if every woman listens to
Madame Rosamund. That is what she cannot see. Her
genius blinds her. You say I am a friend of Madame
Rosamund. I am. Madame Rosamund was educated in
Paris, at the same school as my aunt and myself. But I
have never helped her in her mission. And I never will.
My vocation is elsewhere. When she fled over here from
the English police, she came to me. I received her. She
asked me to drive her to certain addresses. I did so. She
was my guest. I surrounded her with all that she had
abandoned, all that her genius had forced her to abandon.
But I never spoke to her of her work, nor she to me of it.
Still, I dare to think that I was of some value to the woman
in Madame Rosamund.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey felt very young and awkward and defiant. She
felt defiant because Madame Piriac had impressed her,
and she was determined not to be impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you wanted to tell me all this,&#8221; said she, putting
down her glass, with the straws in it, on a small round
table laden with tiny figures in silver. &#8220;Why did you
want to tell me, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell you because I want you to do nothing
that you will regret. You greatly interested me the moment
I saw you. And when I saw you in that studio, in that
Quarter, I feared for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feared what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared that you might mistake your vocation&mdash;that
vocation which is so clearly written on your face. I saw
a woman young and free and rich, and I was afraid that
she might waste everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you know anything about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac paused before replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but what I see. But I see that you are in
a high degree what all women are to a greater extent
than men&mdash;an individualist. You know the feeling that
comes over a woman in hours of complete intimacy with
a man? You know what I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; Audrey agreed, blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;In those moments we perceive that only the individual
counts with us. And with you, above all, the individual
should count. Unless you use your youth and your freedom
and your money for some individual, you will never be
content; you will eternally regret. All that is in your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey blushed more, thinking of certain plans formed
in that head of hers. She said nothing. She was both
very pleased and very exasperated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a relative in England, a young girl,&#8221; Madame
Piriac proceeded, &#8220;in some unpronounceable county. We
write to each other. She is excessively English.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was scarlet. Several times during the sojourn
in Paris she had sent letters (to Madame Piriac) to be
posted in Essex by Mr. Foulger. These letters were full
of quaint inventions about winter life in Essex, and other
matters.</p>

<p>Madame Piriac, looking reflectively at the red embers
of wood in the grate, went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;She says she may come to Paris soon. I have often
asked her to come, but she has refused. Perhaps next
month I shall go to England to fetch her. I should like
her to know you&mdash;very much. She is younger than you
are, but only a little, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted, if I am here,&#8221; Audrey stammered,
and she rose. &#8220;You are a very kind woman. Very, very
amiable. You do not know how much I admire you. I
wish I was like you. But I am not. You have seen only
one side of me. You should see the inside. It is very
strange. I must go to London. I am forced to go to
London. I should be a coward if I did not go to London.
Tell me, is my dress really good? Or is it a deception?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac smiled, and kissed her on both cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good,&#8221; said Madame Piriac. &#8220;But your maid is
not all that she ought to be. However, it is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had simply praised it, and only that, I should
not have been content,&#8221; said Audrey, and kissed Madame
Piriac in the English way, the youthful and direct way.</p>

<p>Not another word about the male sex, the female sex,
tradition or individualism, passed between them.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman was summoned to take Audrey across the
river to the right bank. They went in a taxi. He was
protective and very silent. But just as the cab was
turning out of the Rue de Rivoli into the Rue Castiglione
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall obey you absolutely, Mrs. Moncreiff. It is
a great pleasure for an old, lonely man to keep a secret
for a young and charming woman. A greater pleasure
than you can possibly imagine. You may count on me.
I am not a talker, but you have put me under an obligation,
and I am very grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took care that her thanks should reward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie,&#8221; she burst out in the rose-coloured secrecy
of the bedroom, &#8220;has Elise gone to bed? ... All right.
Well, I&#8217;m lost. Madame Piniac is going to England to
fetch me.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PAGET GARDENS</h3>


<p>&#8220;Has anything happened in this town?&#8221; asked Audrey
of Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the day following their arrival
in London from Paris, and it was a fine afternoon. They
were walking from the Charing Cross Hotel, where they
had slept, to Paget Gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything happened?&#8221; repeated Miss Ingate. &#8220;What
you mean? I don&#8217;t see anything vehy particular on the
posters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody looks so sad and worried, compared with
people in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they do! So they do!&#8221; cried Miss Ingate. &#8220;Oh,
yes! So they do! I wondered what it was seemed so
queer. That&#8217;s it. Well, of course you mustn&#8217;t forget we&#8217;re
in England. I always did say it was a vehy peculiar place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do <em>we</em> look like that?&#8221; Audrey suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure that I don&#8217;t, Winnie, anyway. I&#8217;m
really very cheerful. I&#8217;m surprisingly cheerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true. Also she both looked and felt more girlish
than ever in Paris. Impossible to divine, watching her in
her light clothes, and with her airy step, that she was the
relict of a man who had so tragically died of blood-poisoning
caused by bad table manners.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to ask a policeman,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not,&#8221; Miss Ingate warned her.</p>

<p>Audrey instantly turned into the roadway, treating the
creosoted wood as though it had been rose-strewn velvet,
and reached a refuge where a policeman was standing. The
policeman bent with benevolence and politeness to listen to
her tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; she said, smiling innocently up at him,
&#8220;but is anything the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>What</em> street, miss?&#8221; he questioned, bending lower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anything the matter? All the people round here are
so gloomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The policeman glanced at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be something the matter,&#8221; he remarked
calmly. &#8220;There will be something the matter pretty soon
if I have much more of that suffragette sauce. I thought
you was one of them the moment I saw you, but I wasn&#8217;t
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the first time Audrey had ever spoken to a
policeman, save Inspector Keeble, at Moze, who was a
friendly human being. And she had a little pang of fear.
The policeman was like a high wall of blue cloth, with a
marvellous imitation of a human face at the top, and above
the face a cupola.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she murmured reproachfully, and
hastened back to Miss Ingate, who heard the tale with a
grinning awe that was, nevertheless, sardonic. They
pressed onwards to Piccadilly Circus, where the only normal
and cheerful living creatures were the van horses and the
flower-women; and up Regent Street, through crowds of
rapt and mystical women and romantical men who had
apparently wandered out of a play by Henrik Ibsen.</p>

<p>They then took a motor-bus, which was full of the same
enigmatic, far-gazing heroines and heroes. When they
got off, the conductor pointed dreamily in a certain direction
and murmured the words: &#8220;Paget Square.&#8221; Their desire
was Paget Gardens, and, after finding Paget Square, Paget
Mansions, Paget Houses, Paget Street, Paget Mews, and
Upper Paget Street, they found Paget Gardens. It was a
terrace of huge and fashionable houses fronting on an
immense, blank brick wall. The houses were very lofty;
so lofty that the architect, presumably afraid of hitting
heaven with his patent chimney cowls, had sunk the lowest
storey deep into the earth. Looking over the high palisades
which protected the pavement from the precipice thus made,
one could plainly see the lowest storey and all that was
therein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever can she be staying with?&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Ingate. &#8220;It&#8217;s a marchioness at least. There&#8217;s no doubt
the very best people are now in the movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey went first up massive steps, and, choosing with
marked presence of mind the right bell, rang it, expecting
to see either a butler or a footman.</p>

<p>A young woman, however, answered the ring. She wore
a rather shabby serge frock, but no apron, and she did not
resemble any kind of servant. Her ruddy, heavy, and
slightly resentful face fronted the visitors with a steady,
challenging stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Miss Nickall live here?&#8221; asked Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye! She does!&#8221; came the answer, with a northern
accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to see how she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happen ye&#8217;d better step inside, then,&#8221; said the young
woman.</p>

<p>They stepped inside to an enormous and obscure interior;
the guardian banged the door, and negligently led them
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a large house,&#8221; Miss Ingate ventured, against the
silent intimidation of the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;One o&#8217; them rich uns,&#8221; said the guardian. &#8220;She
lends it to the Cause when she doesn&#8217;t want it herself, to
show her sympathy. Saves her a caretaker&mdash;they all know
I&#8217;m one to look right well after a house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having passed two very spacious rooms and a wide
staircase, she opened the door of a smaller but still a considerable
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here y&#8217;are,&#8221; she muttered.</p>

<p>This room, like the others, was thoroughly sheeted, and
thus presented a misty and spectral appearance. All the
chairs, the chandelier, and all the pictures, were masked
in close-fitting pale yellow. The curtains were down, the
carpet was up, and a dust sheet was spread under the table
in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s some friends of yours,&#8221; said the guardian,
throwing her words across the room.</p>

<p>In an easy chair near the fireplace sat Miss Nickall, her
arm in splints and in a sling. She was very thin and very
pallid, and her eyes brightly glittered. The customary kind
expression of her face was modified, though not impaired,
by a look of vague apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind how ye handle her,&#8221; the guardian gave warning,
when Nick yielded herself to be embraced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just a bit of my Paris come to see me,&#8221; said
Nick, with her American accent. Then through her tears:
&#8220;How&#8217;s Tommy, and how&#8217;s Musa, and how&#8217;s&mdash;how&#8217;s my
studio? Oh! This is Miss Susan Foley, sister of Jane
Foley. Jane will be here for tea. Susan&mdash;Miss Ingate and
Mrs. Moncreiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan gave a grim bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Jane Foley coming? Does she live here?&#8221; asked
Miss Ingate, properly impressed by the name of her who
was the St. George of Suffragism, and perhaps the most
efficient of all militants. &#8220;Audrey, we are in luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Nick had gathered items of information about
Paris, she burst out:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve only met you once before. You&#8217;re
just like old friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are old friends,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;Your letters
to Winnie have made us old friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when did you come over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; Miss Ingate replied. &#8220;We should have
called this morning to see you, but Mrs. Moncreiff had so
much business to do and people to see. I don&#8217;t know what
it all was. She&#8217;s very mysterious.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a fact, Audrey had had an interview with Mr.
Foulger, who, with laudable obedience, had come up to
town from Chelmsford in response to a telegram. Miss
Ingate was aware of this, but she was not aware of other
and more recondite interviews which Audrey had accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did this happen?&#8221; eagerly inquired Miss
Ingate, at last, pointing to the bandaged arm.</p>

<p>Nick&#8217;s face showed discomfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t let us talk about that,&#8221; said Nick. &#8220;It
was a policeman. I don&#8217;t think he meant it. I had
chained myself to the railings of St. Margaret&#8217;s Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan Foley put in laconically:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not to be worried. I hope ye&#8217;ll stay for tea.
We shall have tea at five sharp. Janey&#8217;ll be in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t they sleep here, Susan?&#8221; Nick whimpered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they can, and welcome,&#8221; said Susan.
&#8220;There&#8217;s more empty beds in this barracks than they could
sleep in if they slept all day and all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re staying at an hotel. We can&#8217;t possibly put
you to all this trouble,&#8221; Audrey protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No trouble. It&#8217;s my business. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here
for,&#8221; said Susan Foley. &#8220;I&#8217;d sooner have it than mill work
any day o&#8217; the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just going to be very mean if you don&#8217;t stay
here,&#8221; Nick faltered. Tears stood in her eyes again. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t know how I feel.&#8221; She murmured something about
Betty Burke&#8217;s doings,</p>

<p>&#8220;We will stay! We will stay!&#8221; Miss Ingate agreed
hastily. And, unperceived by Nick, she gave Audrey a
glance in which irony and tenderness were mingled. It
was as if she had whispered, &#8220;The nerves of this angel have
all gone to pieces. We must humour the little sentimental
simpleton.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_21" id="chapter_21" />CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>JANE</h3>


<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve begun, ye see,&#8221; said Susan Foley.</p>

<p>It was two minutes past five, and Miss Ingate and
Audrey, followed by Nick with her slung arm, entered the
sheeted living-room. Tremendous feats had been performed.
All the Moncreiff and Ingate luggage, less than two hours
earlier lying at the Charing Cross Hotel, was now in two
adjoining rooms on the third floor of the great house in
Paget Gardens. Drivers and loiterers had assisted, under
the strict and taciturn control of Susan Foley. Also Nick,
Miss Ingate, and Audrey had had a most intimate conversation,
and the two latter had changed their attire to suit the
station of campers in a palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely to be quite free and independent,&#8221; Audrey
had said, and the statement had been acclaimed.</p>

<p>Jane Foley was seated opposite her sister at the small
table plainly set for five. She rose vivaciously, and came
forward with outstretched hand. She wore a blue skirt and
a white blouse and brown boots. She was twenty-eight,
but her rather small proportions and her plentiful golden,
fluffy hair made her seem about twenty. Her face was less
homely than Susan&#8217;s, and more mobile. She smiled somewhat
shyly, with an extraordinary radiant cheerfulness. It
was impossible for her to conceal the fact that she was very
good-natured and very happy. Finally, she limped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Susan <em>will</em> have the meals prompt,&#8221; she said, as they
all sat down. &#8220;And as Susan left home on purpose to look
after me, of course she&#8217;s the mistress. As far as that goes,
she always was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan was spreading jam on a slice of bread-and-butter
for the one-armed Nick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you don&#8217;t remember me playing the barrel
organ all down Regent Street that day, do you?&#8221; said
Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; quite well. You were magnificent!&#8221; answered
Jane, with blue eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, though I only just saw you&mdash;I was so busy&mdash;I
should remember you anywhere, Miss Foley,&#8221; said Miss
Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you notice any difference in her?&#8221; questioned
Susan Foley harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-o,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;Except, perhaps, she looks
even younger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you notice she&#8217;s lame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;yes, I did. But you didn&#8217;t expect me to
mention that, did you? I thought your sister had just
sprained her ankle, or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Susan. &#8220;It&#8217;s for life. Tell them about it,
Jenny. They don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane Foley laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all in the day&#8217;s work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was at
my last visit to Holloway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey, gazing at her entranced, like a child, murmured
with awe:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been to prison, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three times,&#8221; said Jane pleasantly. &#8220;And I shall be
going again soon. I&#8217;m only out while they&#8217;re trying to
think of some new way of dealing with me, poor things!
I&#8217;m generally watched. It must cost them a fearful lot of
money. But what are they to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how were you lamed? I can&#8217;t eat any tea if you
don&#8217;t tell me&mdash;really I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right!&#8221; Jane laughed. &#8220;It was after that
Liberal mass meeting in Peel Park, at Bradford. I&#8217;d begun
to ask questions, as usual, you know&mdash;questions they can&#8217;t
answer&mdash;and then some Liberal stewards, with lovely rosettes
in their buttonholes, came round me and started cutting my
coat with their penknives. They cut it all to pieces. You
see that was the best argument they could think of in the
excitement of the moment. I believe they&#8217;d have cut up
every stitch I had, only perhaps it began to dawn on them
that it might be awkward for them. Then two of them
lifted me up, one by the feet and the other by the shoulders,
and carried me off. They wouldn&#8217;t let me walk. I told
them they&#8217;d hurt my leg, but they were too busy to listen.
As soon as they came across a policeman they said they had
done it all to save me from being thrown into the lake by
a brutal and infuriated mob. I just had enough breath left
to thank them. Of course, the police weren&#8217;t going to stand
that, so I was taken that night to London. Everything was
thought of except my tea. But I expect they forgot that on
purpose so that I should be properly hungry when I got to
Holloway. However, I said to myself, &#8216;If I can&#8217;t eat and
drink when <em>I</em> want, I won&#8217;t eat and drink when <em>they</em> want!&#8217;
And I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;After I&#8217;d paid my respects at Bow Street, and was
back at Holloway, I just stamped on everything they offered
me, and wrote a petition to the Governor asking to be
treated as a political prisoner. Instead of granting the petition
he kept sending me more and more beautiful food, and
I kept stamping on it. Then three magistrates arrived and
sat on my case, and sentenced me to the punishment cells.
They ran off as soon as they&#8217;d sentenced me. I said I
wouldn&#8217;t go to their punishment cells. I told everybody
again how lame I was. So five wardresses carried me there,
but they dropped me twice on the way. It was a very
interesting cell, the punishment cell was. If it had been
in the Tower, everybody would go to look at it because of
its quaintness. There were two pools of water near to the
bed. I was three days in the cell, and those pools of water
were always there; I could see them because from where I
lay on the bed the light glinted on them. Just one gleam
from the tiny cobwebby window high up. I hadn&#8217;t anything
to read, of course, but even if I&#8217;d had something I
couldn&#8217;t see to read. The bed was two planks, just raised
an inch or two above the water, and the pillow was wooden.
Never any trouble about making beds like that! The entire
furniture of this cosy drawing-room was&mdash;you&#8217;ll never
guess&mdash;a tree-stump, meant for a chair, I think. And on
this tree-stump was an india-rubber cup. I could just see it
across the cell.</p>

<p>&#8220;At night the wardresses were struck with pity, or
perhaps it was the Governor. Anyhow, they brought me
a mattress and a rug. They told me to get up off the
bed, and I told them I couldn&#8217;t get up, couldn&#8217;t even
turn over. So they said, &#8216;Very well, then; you can do
without these things,&#8217; and they took them away. The
funny thing was that I really couldn&#8217;t get up. If I tried
to move, my leg made me want to shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;After three days they decided to take me to the prison
hospital. I shrieked all the way&mdash;couldn&#8217;t help it. They
laughed. So then I laughed. In the hospital, the doctor
decided that my left ankle was sprained and my right
thigh broken. So I had the best of them, after all. They
had to admit they were wrong. It was most awkward
for them. Then I thought I might as well begin to eat.
But they had to be very careful what they gave me. I
hadn&#8217;t had anything for nearly six days, you see. They
were in a fearful stew. Doctor was there day and night.
And it wasn&#8217;t his fault. I told him he had all my sympathies.
He said he was very sorry I should be lame for life, but
it couldn&#8217;t be helped, as the thigh had been left too long.
I said, &#8216;Please don&#8217;t mention it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did they keep you after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep me! They implored my friends to take me away.
No man was ever more relieved that the poor dear Governor
of Holloway Prison, and the Home Secretary himself, too,
when I left in a motor ambulance. The Governor raised
his hat to two of my friends. He would have eaten out
of my hand if I&#8217;d had a few more days to tame him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey&#8217;s childlike and intense gaze had become extremely
noticeable. Jane Foley felt it upon herself, and grew a
little self-conscious. Susan Foley noticed it with eager
and grim pride, and she made a sharp movement instead
of saying: &#8220;Yes, you do well to stare. You&#8217;ve got
something worth staring at.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick noticed it, with moisture in her glittering, hysteric
eyes. Miss Ingate noticed it ironically. &#8220;You, pretending
to be a widow, and so knowing and so superior! Why,
you&#8217;re a schoolgirl!&#8221; said the expressive curve of Miss
Ingate&#8217;s shut lips.</p>

<p>And, in fact, Audrey was now younger than she had
ever been in Paris. She was the girl of six or seven
years earlier, who, at night at school, used to insist upon
hearing stories of real people, either from a sympathetic
teacher or from the other member of the celebrated secret
society. But she had never heard any tale to compare
with Jane Foley&#8217;s. It was incredible that this straightforward,
simple girl at the table should be the world-renowned
Jane Foley. What most impressed Audrey in
Jane was Jane&#8217;s happiness. Jane was happy, as Audrey
had not imagined that anyone could be happy. She had
within her a supply of happiness that was constantly
bubbling up. The ridiculousness and the total futility of
such matters as motor-cars, fine raiment, beautiful boudoirs
and correctness smote Audrey severely. She saw that there
was only one thing worth having, and that was the
mysterious thing that Jane Foley had. This mysterious
thing rendered innocuous cruelty, stupidity and injustice,
and reduced them to rather pathetic trifles.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I never saw all this in the papers!&#8221; Audrey
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No paper&mdash;I mean no respectable paper&mdash;would print it.
Of course, we printed it in our own weekly paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t any respectable paper print it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s not nice. Don&#8217;t you see that I ought
to have been at home mending stockings instead of gallivanting
round with Liberal stewards and policemen and
prison governors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why aren&#8217;t you mending stockings?&#8221; asked Audrey,
with a delicious quizzical smile that crept gradually through
the wonder and admiration in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You pal!&#8221; cried Jane Foley impulsively. &#8220;I must
hug you!&#8221; And she did. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why I&#8217;m not
mending stockings, and why Susan has had to leave off
mending stockings in order to look after me. Susan and
I worked in a mill when she was ten and I was eleven.
We were &#8216;tenters.&#8217; We used to get up at four or five
in the morning and help with the housework, and then
put on our clogs and shawls and be at the mill at six.
We worked till twelve, and then in the afternoon we went
to school. The next day we went to school in the morning
and to the mill in the afternoon. When we were thirteen
we left school altogether, and worked twelve hours a day
in the mill. In the evenings we had to do housework.
In fact, all our housework was done before half-past five
in the morning and after half-past six in the evening.
We had to work just as hard as the men and boys in the
mill. We got a great deal less money and a great deal
less decent treatment; but to make up we had to slave
in the early morning and late at night, while the men
either snored or smoked. I was all right. But Susan
wasn&#8217;t. And a lot of women weren&#8217;t, especially young
mothers with babies. So I learnt typewriting on the quiet,
and left it all to try and find out whether something couldn&#8217;t
be done. I soon found out&mdash;after I&#8217;d heard Rosamund
speak. That&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;m not mending stockings.
I&#8217;m not blaming anybody. It&#8217;s no one&#8217;s fault, really. It
certainly isn&#8217;t men&#8217;s fault. Only something has to be
altered, and most people detest alterations. Still, they
do get done somehow in the end. And so there you
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should love to help,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;I expect I&#8217;m
not much good, but I should love to.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dared not refer to her wealth, of which, in fact,
she was rather ashamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can help, all right,&#8221; said Jane Foley, rising.
&#8220;Are you a member?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I will be to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll give you something to do,&#8221; said Jane Foley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes!&#8221; remarked Miss Ingate. &#8220;They&#8217;ll keep you
busy enough&mdash;<em>and</em> charge you for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan Foley began to clear the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper at nine,&#8221; said she curtly.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />

<h3>THE DETECTIVE</h3>


<p>Audrey and Miss Ingate were writing letters to Paris.
Jane Foley had gone forth again to a committee meeting,
which was understood to be closely connected with a great
Liberal demonstration shortly to be held in a Midland
fortress of Liberalism. Miss Nickall, in accordance with
medical instructions, had been put to bed. Susan Foley
was in the basement, either clearing up tea or preparing
supper.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate, putting her pen between her teeth and
looking up from a blotting-pad, said to Audrey across
the table:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you writing to Musa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; said Audrey, with fire. &#8220;Why should
I write to Musa?&#8221; She added: &#8220;But you can write to
him, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Can I?&#8221; observed Miss Ingate, grinning.</p>

<p>Audrey knew of no reason why she should blush before
Miss Ingate, yet she began to blush. She resolved not to
blush; she put all her individual force into the enterprise
of resisting the tide of blood to her cheeks, but the tide
absolutely ignored her, as the tide of ocean might have
ignored her.</p>

<p>She rose from the table, and, going into a corner,
fidgeted with the electric switches, turning certain additional
lights off and on.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Miss Ingate; &#8220;I&#8217;ll write to him.
I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll expect something. Have you finished your
letters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s this one on the table, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t go on with that one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any message for Musa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might tell him,&#8221; said Audrey, carefully examining
the drawn curtains of the window, &#8220;that I happened to
meet a French concert agent this morning who was very
interested in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; cried Miss Ingate. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was when I was out with Mr. Foulger. The agent
asked me whether I&#8217;d heard a man named Musa play in
Paris. Of course I said I had. He told me he meant
to take him up and arrange a tour for him. So you might
tell Musa he ought to be prepared for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonders will never cease!&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;Have
I got enough stamps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything wonderful in it,&#8221; Audrey sharply
replied. &#8220;Lots of people in Paris know he&#8217;s a great
player, and those Jew concert agents are always awfully
keen&mdash;at least, so I&#8217;m told. Well, perhaps, after all, you&#8217;d
better not tell him. It might make him conceited....
Now, look here, Winnie, do hurry up, and let&#8217;s go out
and post those letters. I can&#8217;t stand this huge house.
I keep on imagining all the empty rooms in it. Hurry
up and come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Miss Ingate shouted downstairs into
the earth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Foley, we&#8217;re both just going out to post some
letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The faint reply came:</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper at nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the farther corner of Paget Square they discovered
a pillar-box standing solitary in the chill night among the
vast and threatening architecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do let&#8217;s go to a café,&#8221; suggested Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;A café?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I want to be jolly. I must break loose somewhere
to-night. I can&#8217;t wait till to-morrow. I was feeling
splendid till Jane Foley went. Then the house began to
get on my nerves, not to mention Susan Foley, with her
supper at nine. Do all people in London fix their meals
hours and hours beforehand? I suppose they do. We
used to at Moze. But I&#8217;d forgotten. Come <em>along</em>, Winnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are no cafés in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be some cafés somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only public-houses and restaurants. Of course, we
could go to a teashop, but they&#8217;re all shut up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, what do people do in London when they
want to be jolly? I always thought London was a
terrific town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They never want to be jolly,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;If
they feel as if they couldn&#8217;t help being jolly, then they
hire a private room somewhere and draw the blinds
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>With no more words, Audrey seized Miss Ingate by
the arm and they walked off, out of the square and into
empty and silent streets where highly disciplined gas-lamps
kept strict watch over the deportment of colossal houses.
In their rapid stroll they seemed to cover miles, but they
could not escape from the labyrinth of tremendous and
correct houses, which in squares and in terraces and in
crescents displayed the everlasting characteristics of comfort,
propriety and self-satisfaction. Now and then a wayfarer
passed them. Now and then a taxicab sped through the
avenues of darkness like a criminal pursued by the impalpable.
Now and then a red light flickered in a porch instead
of a white one. But there was no surcease from the sinister
spell until suddenly they emerged into a long, wide, illumined
thoroughfare of shut shops that stretched to infinity on
either hand. And a vermilion motor-bus meandered by,
and this motor-bus was so sad, so inexpressibly wistful, in
the solemn wilderness of the empty artery, that the two
women fled from the strange scene and penetrated once
more into the gigantic and fearful maze from which they
had for an instant stood free. Soon they were quite lost.
Till that day and night Audrey had had a notion that Miss
Ingate, though bizarre, did indeed know every street in
London. The delusion was destroyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;If we keep on we&#8217;re
bound to come to a cabstand, and then we can take a taxi
and go wherever we like&mdash;Regent Street, Piccadilly, anywhere.
That&#8217;s the convenience of London. As soon as
you come to a cabstand you&#8217;re all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, in the distance, Audrey saw a man apparently
tampering with a gate that led to an area.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said excitedly, &#8220;that&#8217;s the house we&#8217;re
staying in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
Paget Gardens, because there are houses on both sides of it
and there&#8217;s a big wall on one side of Paget Gardens. I&#8217;m
sure we&#8217;re at least two miles off our beds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, how is it Nick&#8217;s hairbrushes are on the
window-sill there, where she put them when she went to
bed? I can see them quite plain. This is the side street&mdash;what&#8217;s-its-name?
There&#8217;s the wall over there at the end.
Don&#8217;t you remember&mdash;it&#8217;s a corner house. This is the side
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; admitted Miss Ingate. &#8220;What
can that man be doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>They plainly saw him open the gate and disappear down
the area steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a burglar,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;This part must be a
regular paradise for burglars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely a detective,&#8221; Miss Ingate suggested.</p>

<p>Audrey was thrilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope it is!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;How heavenly!
Miss Foley said she was being watched, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What had we better do?&#8221; Miss Ingate faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do, Winnie?&#8221; Audrey whispered, tugging at her arm.
&#8220;We must run in at the front door and tell Supper-at-nine-o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>They kept cautiously on the far side of the street until
the end of it, when they crossed over, nipped into the dark
porch of the house and rang the bell.</p>

<p>Susan Foley opened for them. There was no light in
the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is there?&#8221; said Susan Foley, very calmly, when
she heard the news. &#8220;I think I know who it is. I&#8217;ve seen
him hanging round my scullery door before. How did he
climb over those railings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t. He opened the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I locked the gate myself this afternoon. So he&#8217;s
got a key. I shall manage him all right. We&#8217;ll get the
fire-extinguishers. There&#8217;s about a dozen of &#8217;em, I should
think, in this house. They&#8217;re rather heavy, but we can
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning on the light in the hall, she immediately lifted
from its hook a red-coloured metal cone about twenty inches
long and eight inches in diameter at the base. &#8220;In case of
fire drive in knob by hard blow against floor, and let
liquid play on flames,&#8221; she read the instructions on the
side. &#8220;I know them things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It spurts out
like a fountain, and it&#8217;s a rather nasty chemistry sort of a
fluid. I shall take one downstairs to the scullery, and the
others we&#8217;ll have upstairs in the room over Miss Nickall&#8217;s.
We can put &#8217;em in the housemaid&#8217;s lift.... I shall open
the scullery door and leave it a bit open like, and when he
comes in I&#8217;ll be ready for him behind the door with this.
If he thinks he can come spying after our Janey like
this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Miss Ingate began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t feeling very well, are ye, miss?&#8221; Susan
Foley demanded, as she put two extinguishers into the
housemaid&#8217;s lift. &#8220;Better go and sit down in the parlour.
You won&#8217;t be wanted. Mrs. Moncreiff and me can
manage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we can!&#8221; agreed Audrey enthusiastically. &#8220;Run
along, Winnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>After about two minutes of hard labour Susan ran away
and brought a key to Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sneak out,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and lock the gate on him.
I lay he&#8217;ll want a new suit of clothes when I done with
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ecstatically, joyfully, Audrey took the key and departed.
Miss Ingate was sitting in the hall, staring about her like an
undecided bird. Audrey crept round into the side street.
Nobody was in sight. She could not see over the railings,
but she could see between them into the abyss of the area.
The man was there. She could distinguish his dark form
against the inner wall. With every conspiratorial precaution,
she pulled the gate to, inserted the key, and locked it.</p>

<p>A light went up in the scullery window, of which the
blind was drawn. The man peeped at the sides of the
blind. Then the scullery door was opened. The man
started. A piece of wood was thrown out on to the floor
of the area, and the door swung outwards. Then the
light in the scullery was extinguished. The man waited
a few moments. He had noticed that the door was not
quite closed, and the interstice irresistibly fascinated him.
He approached and put his hand against the door. It
yielded. He entered. The next instant there was a bang
and a cry, and a strong spray of white liquid appeared, in
the middle of which was the man&#8217;s head. The door slammed
and a bolt was shot. The man, spluttering, coughing, and
swearing, rubbed his eyes and wiped water from his face
with his hands. His hat was on the ground. At first he
could not see at all, but presently he felt his way towards
the steps and began to climb them. Audrey ran off towards
the corner. She could see and hear him shaking the gate and
then trying to get a key into it. But as Audrey had left her
key in the other side of the lock, he failed in the attempt.</p>

<p>The next thing was that a window opened in the high
wall-face of the house and an immense stream of liquid
descended full on the man&#8217;s head. Susan Foley was at
the window, but only the nozzle of the extinguisher could
be seen. The man tried to climb over the railings; he did
not succeed; they had been especially designed to prevent
such feats. He ran down the steps. The shower faithfully
followed him. In no corner of his hiding did the bountiful
spray neglect him. As soon as one supply of liquid
slackened another commenced. Sometimes there were two
at once. The man ran up the steps again and made another
effort to reach the safety of the street. Audrey could restrain
herself no more. She came, palpitating with joyous
vitality, towards the area gate with the innocent mien of
a passer-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever is the matter?&#8221; she exclaimed, stopping as
if thunderstruck. But in the gloom her eyes were dancing
fires. She was elated as she had never been.</p>

<p>The man only coughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to take shower-baths like this in the
street,&#8221; she said, veiling the laughter in her voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not allowed. But I suppose you&#8217;re doing it for a bet or
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>The downpour ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, miss,&#8221; said he, between coughs, &#8220;unlock this
gate for me. Here&#8217;s the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do no such thing,&#8221; Audrey replied. &#8220;I believe
you&#8217;re a burglar. I shall fetch a policeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she turned back.</p>

<p>In the house, Miss Ingate was coming slowly down the
stairs, a fire-extinguisher in her arms, like a red baby. She
had a sardonic smile, but there was diffidence in it, which
showed, perhaps, that it was directed within.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve saved one,&#8221; she said, pointing to an extinguisher,
&#8220;in case there should be a fire in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later Susan Foley appeared at the door of the
living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she announced calmly. &#8220;Supper&#8217;s
ready. We shan&#8217;t wait for Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jane Foley arrived, a reconnaissance proved that
the martyrised detective had contrived to get away.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_23" id="chapter_23" />CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE BLUE CITY</h3>


<p>In the following month, on a Saturday afternoon, Audrey,
Miss Ingate, and Jane Foley were seated at an open-air
café in the Blue City.</p>

<p>The Blue City, now no more, was, as may be remembered,
Birmingham&#8217;s reply to the White City of London,
and the imitative White City of Manchester. Birmingham,
in that year, was not imitative, and, with its chemical
knowledge, it had discovered that certain shades of blue
would resist the effects of smoke far more successfully than
any shade of white. And experience even showed that these
shades of blue were improved, made more delicate and
romantic, by smoke. The total impression of the show&mdash;which
it need hardly be said was situated in the polite
Edgbaston district&mdash;was ethereal, especially when its
minarets and towers, all in accordance with the taste of the
period, were beheld from a distance. Nor was the exhibition
entirely devoted to pleasure. It had a moral object, and
that object was to demonstrate the progress of civilisation
in our islands. Its official title, indeed, was &#8220;The National
Progress Exhibition,&#8221; but the citizens of Birmingham and
the vicinity never called it anything but the Blue City.</p>

<p>On that Saturday afternoon a Cabinet Minister historically
hostile to the idols of Birmingham was about to
address a mass meeting in the Imperial Hall of the
Exhibition, which held seven thousand people, in order to
prove to Birmingham that the Government of which he was
a member had done far more for national progress than any
other Government had done for national progress in the same
length of time. The presence of the Cabinet Minister
accounted for the presence of Jane Foley; the presence of
Jane Foley accounted for the presence of Audrey; and the
presence of Audrey accounted for the presence of Miss
Ingate.</p>

<p>Although she was one of the chief organisers of victory,
and perhaps&mdash;next to Rosamund and the family trio whose
Christian names were three sweet symphonies&mdash;the principal
asset of the Suffragette Union, Jane Foley had not taken
an active part in the Union&#8217;s arrangements for suitably
welcoming the Cabinet Minister; partly because of her
lameness, partly because she was writing a book, and partly
for secret reasons which it would be unfair to divulge.
Nearly at the last moment, however, in consequence of news
that all was not well in the Midlands, she had been sent to
Birmingham, and, after evading the watch of the police, she
had arrived on the previous day in Audrey&#8217;s motor-car,
which at that moment was waiting in the automobile park
outside the principal gates of the Blue City.</p>

<p>The motor-car had been chosen as a means of transit
for the reason that the railway stations were being watched
for notorious suffragettes by members of a police force
whose reputations were at stake. Audrey owed her
possession of a motor-car to the fact that the Union officials
had seemed both startled and grieved when, in response to
questions, she admitted that she had no car. It was communicated
to her that members of the Union as rich as she
reputedly was were expected to own cars for the general
good. Audrey thereupon took measures to own a car.
Having seen in many newspapers an advertisement in which
a firm of middlemen implored the public thus: &#8220;Let us run
your car for you. Let us take all the worry and responsibility,&#8221;
she interviewed the firm, and by writing out a
cheque disembarrassed herself at a stroke of every anxiety
incident to defective magnetos, bad petrol, bad rubber,
punctures, driving licences, bursts, collisions, damages, and
human chauffeurs. She had all the satisfactions of owning
a car without any of the cares. One of the evidences of
progress in the Blue City was an exhibit of this very firm
of middlemen.</p>

<p>From the pale blue tripod table at which sat the three
women could be plainly seen the vast Imperial Hall, flanked
on one side by the great American Dragon Slide, a side-show
loudly demonstrating progress, and on the other by
the unique Joy Wheel side-show. At the doorway of the
latter a man was bawling proofs of progress through a
megaphone.</p>

<p>Immense crowds had been gathering in the Imperial
Hall, and the lines of political enthusiasts bound thither
were now thinning. The Blue City was full of rumours, as
that the Cabinet Minister was too afraid to come, as that
he had been smuggled to the hall inside a tea-chest, and
as that he had walked openly and unchallenged through the
whole Exhibition. It was no rumour, but a sure fact, that
two women had been caught hiding on the roof of the
Imperial Hall, under natural shelters formed by the beams
and boarding supporting the pediment of the eastern façade,
and that they were ammunitioned with flags and leaflets and
a silk ladder, and had made a hole in the roof exactly over
the platform. These two women had been seen in charge
of policemen at the Exhibition police-station. It was understood
by many that they were the last hope of militancy
that afternoon; many others, on the contrary, were convinced
that they had been simply a feint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Miss Ingate suddenly, glancing up at the
Imperial clock, &#8220;I think I shall move outside and sit in the
car. I think that&#8217;ll be the best place for me. I said that
night in Paris that I&#8217;d get my arm broken, but I&#8217;ve changed
my mind about that.&#8221; She rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie,&#8221; protested Audrey, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you going to see
it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m afraid. I played the barrel
organ all the way down Regent Street, and it was smashed
to pieces. But I don&#8217;t want to go to prison. Really, I
don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to. If me going to prison would bring the Vote
a single year nearer, I should say: &#8216;Let it wait a year.&#8217; If
me not going to prison meant no Vote for ever and ever, I
should say: &#8216;Well, struggle on without the Vote.&#8217; I&#8217;ve no
objection to other people going to prison, if it suits them,
but it wouldn&#8217;t suit me. I know it wouldn&#8217;t. So I shall
go outside and sit in the car. If you don&#8217;t come, I shall
know what&#8217;s happened, and you needn&#8217;t worry about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dame duly departed, her lips and eyes equally ironic
about her own prudence and about the rashness of others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have some more lemonade&mdash;shall we?&#8221; said
Jane Foley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s!&#8221; agreed Audrey, with rapture. &#8220;And more
sponge-cake, too! You do look lovely like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane Foley had her profuse hair tightly bound round her
head and powdered grey. It was very advisable for her
to be disguised, and her bright hair was usually the chief
symptom of her in those disturbances which so harassed
the police. She now had the appearance of a neat old lady
kept miraculously young by a pure and cheerful nature.
Audrey, with a plain blue frock and hat which had cost
more than Jane Foley would spend on clothes in twelve
months, had a face dazzling by its ingenuous excitement
and expectation. Her little nose was extraordinarily pert;
her forehead superb; and all her gestures had the same
vivacious charm as was in her eyes. The white-aproned,
streamered girl who took the order for lemonade and
sponge-cakes to a covered bar ornamented by advertisements
of whisky, determined to adopt a composite of the
styles of both the customers on her next ceremonious
Sunday. And a large proportion of the other sippers and
nibblers and of the endless promenading crowds regarded
the pair with pleasure and curiosity, never suspecting that
one of them was the most dangerous woman in England.</p>

<p>The new refreshments, which had been delayed by
reason of an altercation between the waitress and three
extreme youths at a neighbouring table, at last arrived,
and were plopped smartly down between Audrey and Miss
Foley. Having received half a sovereign from Audrey, the
girl returned to the bar for change. &#8220;None o&#8217; your sauce!&#8221;
she threw out, as she passed the youths, who had
apparently discovered new arguments in support of their
case. Audrey was fired by the vigorous independence of the
girl against three males.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if we are caught!&#8221; she murmured low,
looking for the future through the pellucid tumbler. She
added, however: &#8220;But if we are, I shall pay my own fine.
You know I promised that to Miss Ingate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, so long as you don&#8217;t pay mine, my
dear,&#8221; said Jane Foley with an affectionate smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenny!&#8221; Audrey protested, full of heroine-worship.
&#8220;How could you think I would ever do such a mean thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a dull, vague, voluminous sound from the
direction of the Imperial Hall. It lasted for quite a number
of seconds.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s beginning,&#8221; said Jane Foley. &#8220;I do feel sorry
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to start now?&#8221; Audrey asked deferentially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Jane laughed. &#8220;The great thing is to let
them think everything&#8217;s all right. And then, when they&#8217;re
getting careless, let go at them full bang with a beautiful
surprise. There&#8217;ll be a chance of getting away like that.
I believe there are a hundred and fifty stewards in the meeting,
and they&#8217;ll every one be quite useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>At intervals a muffled roar issued from the Imperial
Hall, despite the fact that the windows were closely shut.</p>

<p>In due time Jane Foley quietly rose from the table, and
Audrey did likewise. All around them stretched the imposing
blue architecture of the Exhibition, forming vistas
that ended dimly either in the smoke of Birmingham or the
rustic haze of Worcestershire. And, although the Imperial
Hall was crammed, every vista was thickly powdered with
pleasure-seekers and probably pleasure-finders. Bands
played. Flags waved. Brass glinted. Even the sun
feebly shone at intervals through the eternal canopy of
soot. It was a great day in the annals of the Blue City
and of Liberalism.</p>

<p>And Jane Foley and Audrey turned their backs upon all
that, and&mdash;Jane concealing her limp as much as possible&mdash;sauntered
with affected nonchalance towards the precincts
of the Joy Wheel enclosure. Audrey was inexpressibly uplifted.
She felt as if she had stepped straight into romance.
And she was right&mdash;she had stepped into the most vivid
romance of the modern age, into a world of disguises,
flights, pursuits, chicane, inconceivable adventures, ideals,
martyrs and conquerors, which only the Renaissance or the
twenty-first century could appreciate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lend me that, will you?&#8221; said Jane persuasively to
the man with the megaphone at the entrance to the enclosure.</p>

<p>He was, quite properly, a very loud man, with a loud
thick voice, a loud purple face, and a loud grey suit. To
Audrey&#8217;s astonishment, he smiled and winked, and gave up
the megaphone at once.</p>

<p>Audrey paid sixpence at the turnstile, admittance for two
persons, and they were within the temple, which had a
roof like an umbrella over the central, revolving portion of
it, but which was somewhat open to the skies around the
rim. There were two concentric enclosing walls, the inner
one was unscalable, and the outer one about five feet six
inches high. A second loud man was calling out:
&#8220;Couples please. Ladies <em>and</em> gentlemen. Couples if <em>you</em> please.&#8221; Obediently, numbers of the crowd disposed themselves
in pairs in the attitudes of close affection on the
circling floor which had just come to rest, while the
remainder of the numerous gathering gazed upon them with
sarcastic ecstasy. Then the wheel began slowly to turn,
and girls to shriek in the plenitude of happiness. And
progress was proved geometrically.</p>

<p>Jane, bearing the megaphone, slipped by an aperture
into the space between the two walls, and Audrey followed.
Nobody gave attention to them except the second loud man,
who winked the wink of knowledge. The fact was that
both the loud men, being unalterable Tories, had been very
willing to connive at Jane Foley&#8217;s scheme for the affliction
of a Radical Minister.</p>

<p>The two girls over the wall had an excellent and
appetising view of the upper part of the side of the Imperial
Hall, and of its high windows, the nearest of which was
scarcely thirty feet away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold this, will you?&#8221; said Jane, handing the megaphone
to Audrey.</p>

<p>Jane drew from its concealment in her dress a small
piece of iron to which was attached a coloured streamer
bearing certain words. She threw, with a strong movement
of the left arm, because she was left-handed. She
had practised throwing; throwing was one of her several
specialties. The bit of iron, trailing its motto like a comet
its tail, flew across space and plumped into the window
with a pleasing crash and disappeared, having triumphed
over uncounted police on the outskirts and a hundred and
fifty stewards within. A roar from the interior of the hall
supervened, and varied cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the meg,&#8221; said Jane gently.</p>

<p>The next instant she was shouting through the megaphone,
an instrument which she had seriously studied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Votes for women. Why do you torture women?
Votes for women. Why do you torture women?&#8221;</p>

<p>The uproar increased and subsided. A masterful voice
resounded within the interior. Many people rushed out of
the hall. And there was a great scurry of important and
puzzled feet within a radius of a score of yards.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll try the next window,&#8221; said Jane, handing
over the megaphone. &#8220;You shout while I throw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey&#8217;s heart was violently beating. She took the
megaphone and put it to her lips, but no sound would come.
Then, as though it were breaking through an obstacle, the
sound shot forth, and to Audrey it was a gigantic voice
that functioned quite independently of her will. Tremendously
excited by the noise, she bawled louder and still
louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed,&#8221; said Jane calmly in her ear. &#8220;That&#8217;s
enough, I think. Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they can&#8217;t possibly see us,&#8221; said Audrey, breathless,
lowering the instrument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, dear,&#8221; Jane Foley insisted.</p>

<p>People with open mouths were crowding at the aperture
of the inner wall, but, Jane going first, both girls pushed
safely through the throng. The wheel had stopped. The
entire congregation was staring agog, and in two seconds
everybody divined, or had been nudged to the effect, that
Jane and Audrey were the authoresses of the pother.</p>

<p>Jane still leading, they made for the exit. But the first
loud man rushed chivalrously in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perlice!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Two bobbies a-coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; said the second loud man. &#8220;Here, misses.
Get on the wheel. They&#8217;ll never get ye if ye sit in the
middle back to back.&#8221; He jumped on to the wheel himself,
and indicated the mathematical centre. Jane took the suggestion
in a flash; Audrey was obedient. They fixed themselves
under directions, dropping the megaphone. The
wheel started, and the megaphone rattled across its smooth
surface till it was shot off. A policeman ran in, and hesitated;
another man, in plain clothes, and wearing a rosette,
ran in.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s them,&#8221; said the rosette. &#8220;I saw her with the
grey hair from the gallery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The policeman sprang on to the wheel, and after terrific
efforts fell sprawling and was thrown off. The rosette met
the same destiny. A second policeman appeared, and with
the fearless courage of his cloth, undeterred by the spectacle
of prostrate forms, made a magnificent dash, and was
equally floored.</p>

<p>As Audrey sat very upright, pressing her back against
the back of Jane Foley and clutching at Jane Foley&#8217;s skirts
with her hands behind her&mdash;the locked pair were obliged thus
to hold themselves exactly over the axis of the wheel, for
the slightest change of position would have resulted in their
being flung to the circumference and into the blue grip of
the law&mdash;she had visions of all her life just as though she
had been drowning. She admitted all her follies and
wondered what madness could have prompted her remarkable
escapades both in Paris and out of it. She remembered
Madame Piriac&#8217;s prophecy. She was ready to wish
the past year annihilated and herself back once more in
parental captivity at Moze, the slave of an unalterable
routine imposed by her father, without responsibility, without
initiative and without joy. And she lived again through
the scenes in which she had smiled at the customs official,
fibbed to Rosamund, taken the wounded Musa home in the
taxi, spoken privily with the ageing yacht-owner, and
laughed at the drowned detective in the area of the palace
in Paget Gardens.</p>

<p>Everything happened in her mind while the wheel went
round once, showing her in turn to the various portions
of the audience, and bringing her at length to a second view
of the sprawling policemen. Whereupon she thought
queerly: &#8220;What do I care about the vote, really?&#8221; And
finally she thought with anger and resentment: &#8220;What a
shame it is that women haven&#8217;t got the vote!&#8221; And then
she heard a gay, quiet sound. It was Jane Foley laughing
gently behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you see the big one now, darling?&#8221; asked Jane
roguishly. &#8220;Has he picked himself up again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey laughed.</p>

<p>And at last the audience laughed also. It laughed
because the big policeman, unconquerable, had made
another intrepid dash for the centre of the wheel and fallen
upon his stomach as upon a huge india-rubber ball. The
audience did more than laugh&mdash;it shrieked, yelled, and
guffawed. The performance to be witnessed was worth ten
times the price of entry. Indeed no such performance had
ever before been seen in the whole history of popular amusement.
And in describing the affair the next morning as
&#8220;unique&#8221; the <em>Birmingham Daily Post</em> for once used that
adjective with absolute correctness. The policemen tried
again and yet again. They got within feet, within inches,
of their prey, only to be dragged away by the mysterious
protector of militant maidens&mdash;centrifugal force. Probably
never before in the annals of the struggle for political
freedom had maidens found such a protection, invisible,
sinister and complete. Had the education of policemen in
England included a course of mechanics, these particular
two policemen would have known that they were seeking
the impossible and fighting against that which was stronger
than ten thousand policemen. But they would not give up.
At each fresh attempt they hoped by guile to overcome their
unseen enemy, as the gambler hopes at each fresh throw to
outwit chance. The jeers of the audience pricked them to
desperation, for in encounters with females like Jane Foley
and Audrey they had been accustomed to the active
sympathy of the public. But centrifugal force had
rendered them ridiculous, and the public never sympathises
with those whom ridicule has covered. The strange and side-splitting
effects of centrifugal force had transformed about a
hundred indifferent young men and women into ardent and
convinced supporters of feminism in its most advanced form.</p>

<p>In the course of her slow revolution Audrey saw the
rosetted steward arguing with the second loud man, no
doubt to persuade him to stop the wheel. Then out of the
tail of her eye she saw the steward run violently from the
tent. And then while her back was towards the entrance
she was deafened by a prodigious roar of delight from the
mob. The two policemen had fled also&mdash;probably for reinforcements
and appliances against centrifugal force. In
their pardonable excitement they had, however, committed
the imprudence of departing together. An elementary
knowledge of strategy should have warned them against
such a mistake. The wheel stopped immediately. The
second loud man beckoned with laughter to Jane Foley and
Audrey, who rose and hopefully skipped towards him.
Audrey at any rate was as self-conscious as though she had
been on the stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s th&#8217; back way,&#8221; said the second loud man,
pointing to a coarse curtain in the obscurity of the nether
parts of the enclosure.</p>

<p>They ran, Jane Foley first, and vanished from the
regions of the Joy Wheel amid terrific acclamations given
in a strong Midland accent.</p>

<p>The next moment they found themselves in a part of
the Blue City which nobody had taken the trouble to paint
blue. The one blue object was a small patch of sky, amid
clouds, overhead. On all sides were wooden flying
buttresses, supporting the boundaries of the Joy Wheel
enclosure to the south-east, of the Parade Restaurant and
Bar to the south-west, and of a third establishment of good
cheer to the north. Upon the ground were brick-ends,
cinders, bits of wood, bits of corrugated iron, and all the
litter and refuse cast out of sight of the eyes of visitors to
the Exhibition of Progress.</p>

<p>With the fear of the police behind them they stumbled
forward a few yards, and then saw a small ramshackle
door swinging slightly to and fro on one hinge. Jane Foley
pulled it open. They both went into a narrow passage.
On the mildewed wall of the passage was pinned up a notice
in red ink: &#8220;Any waitress taking away any apron or cap
from the Parade Restaurant and Bar will be fined one
shilling.&#8221; Farther on was another door, also ajar. Jane
Foley pushed against it, and a tiny room of irregular shape
was disclosed. In this room a stout woman in grey was
counting a pile of newly laundered caps and aprons, and
putting them out of one hamper into another. Audrey
remembered seeing the woman at the counter of the
restaurant and bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police are after us. They&#8217;ll be here in a minute,&#8221;
said Jane Foley simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the woman in grey, with the carelessness
of fatigue. &#8220;Are you them stone-throwing lot?
They&#8217;ve just been in to tell me about it. What d&#8217;ye do
it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do it for you&mdash;amongst others,&#8221; Jane Foley smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay! That ye don&#8217;t!&#8221; said the woman positively.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a vote for the city council, and I want no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want us to get caught, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know as I do. Ye look a couple o&#8217; bonny
wenches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have two caps and aprons, then,&#8221; said Jane
Foley smoothly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll pay the shilling fine.&#8221; She
laughed lightly. &#8220;And a bit more. If the police get in
here we shall have to struggle, you know, and they&#8217;ll break
the place up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey produced another half-sovereign.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what shall ye do with yer hats and coats?&#8221; the
woman demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give them to you, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman regarded the hats and coats.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get near them coats,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And if I
put on one o&#8217; them there hats my old man &#8217;ud rise from the
grave&mdash;that he would. Still, I don&#8217;t wish ye any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shut and locked the door.</p>

<p>In about a minute two waitresses in aprons and
streamered caps of immaculate purity emerged from the
secret places of the Parade Restaurant and Bar, slipped
round the end of the counter, and started with easy indifference
to saunter away into the grounds after the manner
of restaurant girls who have been gifted with half an hour
off. The tabled expanse in front of the Parade erection was
busy with people, some sitting at the tables and supporting
the establishment, but many more merely taking advantage
of the pitch to observe all possible exciting developments of
the suffragette shindy.</p>

<p>And as the criminals were modestly getting clear, a loud
and imperious voice called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey, lacking experience, hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey there!&#8221;</p>

<p>They both turned, for the voice would not be denied.
It belonged to a man sitting with another man at a table
on the outskirts of the group of tables. It was the voice
of the rosetted steward, who beckoned in a not unfriendly
style.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring us two liqueur brandies, miss,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;And
look slippy, if ye please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sharp tone, so sure of obedience, gave Audrey a
queer sensation of being in reality a waitress doomed to
tolerate the rough bullying of gentlemen urgently desiring
alcohol. And the fierce thought that women&mdash;especially
restaurant waitresses&mdash;must and should possess the Vote
surged through her mind more powerfully than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never have the chance again,&#8221; she muttered to herself.
And marched to the counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two liqueur brandies, please,&#8221; she said to the woman
in grey, who had left her apron calculations. &#8220;That&#8217;s all
right,&#8221; she murmured, as the woman stared a question at
her. Then the woman smiled to herself, and poured out
the liqueur brandies from a labelled bottle with startling
adroitness, and dashed the full glasses on to a brass tray.</p>

<p>As Audrey walked across the gravel carefully balancing
the tray, she speculated whether the public eye would notice
the shape of her small handbag, which was attached by a
safety pin to her dress beneath the apron, and whether her
streamers were streaming out far behind her head.</p>

<p>Before she could put the tray down on the table, the
rosetted steward, who looked pale, snatched one of the
glasses and gulped down its entire contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted it!&#8221; said he, smacking his lips. &#8220;I wanted
it bad. They&#8217;ll catch &#8217;em all right. I should know the
young &#8217;un again anywhere. I&#8217;ll swear to identify her in
any court. And I will. Tasty little piece o&#8217; goods, too! ...
But not so good-looking as you,&#8221; he added, gazing
suddenly at Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; your sauce,&#8221; snapped Audrey, and walked off,
leaving the tray behind.</p>

<p>The two men exploded into coarse but amiable laughter,
and called to her to return, but she would not. &#8220;You can
pay the other young lady,&#8221; she said over her shoulder,
pointing vaguely to the counter where there was now a
bevy of other young ladies.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Miss Ingate, and the chauffeur also,
received a very appreciable shock. Half an hour later the
car, having called at the telegraph office, and also at the
aghast lodgings of the waitresses to enable them to reattire
and to pack, had quitted Birmingham.</p>

<p>That night they reached Northampton. At the post
office there Jane Foley got a telegram. And when the three
were seated in a corner of the curtained and stuffy dining-room
of the small hotel, Jane said, addressing herself
specially to Audrey:</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be safe for us to return to Paget Gardens
to-morrow. And perhaps not to any of our places in
London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Audrey, who was now
becoming accustomed to the world of conspiracy and
chicane in which Jane Foley carried on her existence with
such a deceiving air of the matter-of-fact. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go anywhere,
won&#8217;t we, Winnie?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Miss Ingate assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane Foley. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just had a telegram
arranging for us to go to Frinton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean Frinton-on-Sea?&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Ingate, suddenly excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> on the sea,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;We have to go
through Colchester. Do you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know it!&#8221; repeated Miss Ingate. &#8220;I know
everybody in Frinton, except the Germans. When I&#8217;m at
home I buy my bacon at Frinton. Are you going to an
hotel there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;To some people named Spatt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody that is anybody named Spatt living at
Frinton,&#8221; said Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t been there long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; murmured Miss Ingate. &#8220;Of course if that&#8217;s
it...! I can&#8217;t guarantee what&#8217;s happened since I began
my pilgrimages. But I think I shall wriggle off home
quietly as soon as we get to Colchester. This afternoon&#8217;s
business has been too feverish for me. When the policeman
held up his hand as we came through Ellsworth I thought
you were caught. I shall just go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care much about going to Frinton, Jenny,&#8221; said
Audrey.</p>

<p>Indeed, Moze lay within not many miles of Frinton-on-Sea.</p>

<p>Then Audrey and Miss Ingate observed a phenomenon
that was both novel and extremely disturbing. Tears came
into the eyes of Jane Foley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it, Audrey, don&#8217;t say it!&#8221; she appealed in
a wet voice. &#8220;I shall have to go myself. And you simply
can&#8217;t imagine how I hate going all alone into these houses
that we&#8217;re invited to. I&#8217;d much sooner be in lodgings, as
we were last night. But these homes in quiet places here
and there are very useful sometimes. They all belong to
members of the Union, you know; and we have to use them.
But I wish we hadn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve met Mrs. Spatt once. I didn&#8217;t
think you&#8217;d throw me over just at the worst part. The
Spatts will take all of us and be glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>("They won&#8217;t take me,&#8221; said Miss Ingate under her
breath.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall come with you,&#8221; said Audrey, caressing the
recreant who, while equal to trifles such as policemen, magistrates,
and prisons, was miserably afraid of a strange
home. In fact Audrey now liked Jane much more than
ever, liked her completely&mdash;and perhaps admired her rather
less, though her admiration was still intense. And the
thought in Audrey&#8217;s mind was: &#8220;Never will I desert this
girl! I&#8217;m a militant, too, now, and I shall stick by her.&#8221;
And she was full of a happiness which she could not understand
and which she did not want to understand.</p>

<p>The next morning all the newspaper posters in Northhampton
bore the words: &#8220;Policemen and suffragettes on
Joy Wheel,&#8221; or some variation of these words. And they
bore nothing else. And in all the towns and many of the
villages through which they passed on the way to Colchester,
the same legend greeted their flying eyes. Audrey
and Miss Ingate, in the motor-car, read with great care all
the papers. Audrey blushed at the descriptions of herself,
which were flattering. It seemed that the Cabinet Minister&#8217;s
political meeting had been seriously damaged by the episode,
for the reason that rumours of the performance on the Joy
Wheel had impaired the spell of eloquence and partially
emptied the hall. And this was the more disappointing in
that the police had been sure that nothing untoward would
occur. It seemed also that the police were on the track of
the criminals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they!&#8221; exclaimed Jane Foley with a beautiful
smile.</p>

<p>Then the car approached a city of towers on a hill, and
as it passed by the station, which was in the valley, Miss
Ingate demanded a halt. She got out in the station yard
and transferred her belongings to a cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall drive home from here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often
done it before. After all, I did play the barrel organ all
the way down Regent Street. Surely I can rest on the
barrel organ, can&#8217;t I, Miss Foley&mdash;at my age? ... What
a business I shall have when I <em>do</em> get home, and nobody
expecting me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when certain minor arrangements had been made,
the car mounted the hill into Colchester and took the
Frinton road, leaving Miss Ingate&#8217;s fly far behind.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_24" id="chapter_24" />CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE SPATTS</h3>


<p>The house of the Spatts was large, imposing and variegated.
It had turrets, balconies, and architectural nooks in such
quantity that the unaided individual eye could not embrace
it all at once. It overlooked, from a height, the grounds
of the Frinton Sports Club, and a new member of this club,
upon first beholding the residence, had made the immortal
remark: &#8220;It wants at least fourteen people to look at it.&#8221;
The house stood in the middle of an unfinished garden,
which promised ultimately to be as heterogeneous as itself,
but which at present was merely an expanse of sorely
wounded earth.</p>

<p>The time was early summer, and therefore the summer
dining-room of the Spatts was in use. This dining-room
consisted of one white, windowed wall, a tiled floor, and a
roof of wood. The windows gave into the winter dining-room,
which was a white apartment, sparsely curtained and
cushioned with chintz, and containing very few pieces of
furniture or pictures. The Spatts considered, rightly, that
furniture and pictures were unhygienic and the secret lairs
of noxious germs. Had the Spatts flourished twenty-five years
earlier their dining-room would have been covered with
brown paper upon which would have hung permanent photographs
of European masterpieces of graphic art, and there
would have been a multiplicity of draperies and specimens
of battered antique furniture, with a warming-pan or so
suspended here and there in place of sporting trophies. But
the Spatts had not begun to flourish twenty-five years ago.
They flourished very few years ago and they still flourish.</p>

<p>As the summer dining-room had only one wall, it follows
that it was open to the powers of the air. This result had
been foreseen by the Spatts&mdash;had indeed been expressly
arranged, for they believed strongly in the powers of the
air, as being beneficent powers. It is true that they generally
had sniffling colds, but their argument was that these
maladies had no connection whatever with the powers of the
air, which, according to their theory, saved them from
much worse.</p>

<p>They and their guests were now seated at dinner.
Twilight was almost lost in night. The table was
illuminated by four candles at the corners, and flames of
these candles flickered in the healthful evening breeze,
dropping pink wax on the candlesticks. They were surrounded
by the mortal remains of tiny moths, but other
tiny moths would not heed the warning and continually shot
themselves into the flames. On the outskirts of the table
moved with silent stealth the forms of two middle-aged and
ugly servants.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spatt was very tall and very thin, and the
simplicity of her pale green dress&mdash;sole reminder of the
brown-paper past&mdash;was calculated to draw attention to these
attributes. She had an important reddish nose, and a
mysterious look of secret confidence, which never left her
even in the most trying crises. Mr. Spatt also was very
tall and very thin. His head was several sizes too small,
and part of his insignificant face, which one was apt to miss
altogether in contemplating his body, was hidden under a
short grey beard. Siegfried Spatt, the sole child of the
union, though but seventeen, was as tall and as thin as his
father and his mother; he had a pale face and red hands.</p>

<p>The guests were Audrey, Jane Foley, and a young
rubicund gentleman, beautifully clothed, and with fair
curly locks, named Ziegler. Mr. Ziegler was far more perfectly
at ease than anybody else at the table, which indeed
as a whole was rendered haggard and nervous by the precarious
state of the conversation, expecting its total
decease at any moment. At intervals someone lifted the
limp dying body&mdash;it sank back&mdash;was lifted again&mdash;struggled
feebly&mdash;relapsed. Young Siegfried was excessively tongue-tied
and self-conscious, and his demeanour frankly admitted
it. Jane Foley, acknowledged heroine in certain fields, sat
like a schoolgirl at her first dinner-party. Audrey maintained
her widowhood, but scarcely with credit. Mr. and
Mrs. Spatt were as usual too deeply concerned about the
awful condition of the universe to display that elasticity of
mood which continuous chatter about nothing in particular
demands. And they were too worshipful of the best London
conventions not to regard silence at table as appalling. In
the part of the country from which Jane Foley sprang, hosts
will sit mute through a meal and think naught of it. But
Mr. and Mrs. Spatt were of different stuff. All these five
appeared to be in serious need of conversation pills. Only
Mr. Ziegler beheld his companions with a satisfied equanimity
that was insensible to spiritual suffering. Happily at the
most acute moments the gentle night wind, meandering
slowly from the east across leagues of North Sea, would
induce in one or another a sneeze which gave some semblance
of vitality and vigour to the scene.</p>

<p>After one of these sneezes it was that Jane Foley,
conscience-stricken, tried to stimulate the exchanges by an
effort of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what are the folks like in Frinton?&#8221; she demanded,
blushing, and looking up. As she looked up young Siegfried
looked down, lest he might encounter her glance and be
utterly discountenanced.</p>

<p>Jane Foley&#8217;s question was unfortunate.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know nothing of them,&#8221; said Mrs. Spatt, pained.
&#8220;Of course I have received and paid a few purely formal
calls. But as regards friends and acquaintances, we prefer
to import them from London. As for the holiday-makers,
one sees them, naturally. They appear to lead an exclusively
physical existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; put in Mr. Spatt stiffly. &#8220;The residents
are no better. The women play golf all day on that
appalling golf course, and then after tea they go into the
town to change their library books. But I do not believe
that they ever read their library books. The mentality of
the town is truly remarkable. However, I am informed
that there are many towns like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; murmured Siegfried Spatt, and then tried,
vainly, to suck back the awful remark whence it had come.</p>

<p>Mr. Ziegler, speaking without passion or sorrow, added
his views about Frinton. He asserted that it was the worst
example of stupid waste of opportunities he had ever encountered,
even in England. He pointed out that there
was no band, no pier, no casino, no shelters&mdash;and not even
a tree; and that there were no rules to govern the place.
He finished by remarking that no German state would
tolerate such a pleasure resort. In this judgment he
employed an excellent English accent, with a scarcely perceptible
thickening of the t&#8217;s and thinning of the d&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Mr. Ziegler left nothing to be said.</p>

<p>Then the conversation sighed and really did expire. It
might have survived had not the Spatts had a rule, explained
previously to those whom it concerned, against
talking shop. Their attachment to this rule was heroic.
In the present instance shop was suffragism. The Spatts
had developed into supporters of militancy in a very
curious way. Mrs. Spatt&#8217;s sister, a widow, had been
mixed up with the Union for years. One day she was fined
forty shillings or a week&#8217;s imprisonment for a political
peccadillo involving a hatpin and a policeman. It was useless
for her to remind the magistrate that she, like Mrs.
Spatt, was the daughter of the celebrated statesman B&mdash;&mdash;,
who in the fifties had done so much for Britain. (Lo!
The source of that mysterious confidence that always supported
Mrs. Spatt!) The magistrate had no historic sense.
She went to prison. At least she was on the way thither
when Mr. Spatt paid the fine in spite of her. The same
night Mr. Spatt wrote to his favourite evening paper to
point out the despicable ingratitude of a country which would
have imprisoned a daughter of the celebrated B&mdash;&mdash;, and
announced that henceforward he would be an active supporter
of suffragism, which hitherto had interested him only
academically. He was a wealthy man, and his money and
his house and his pen were at the service of the Union&mdash;but
always with discretion.</p>

<p>Audrey and Jane Foley had learnt all this privately from
Mrs. Spatt on their arrival, after they had told such part
of their tale as Jane Foley had deemed suitable, and they
had further learnt that suffragism would not be a welcome
topic at their table, partly on account of the servants and
partly on account of Mr. Ziegler, whose opinions were quite
clearly opposed to the movement, but whom they admired
for true and rare culture. He was a cousin of German
residents in First Avenue and, visiting them often,
had been discovered by Mr. Spatt in the afternoon-tea
train.</p>

<p>And just as the ices came to compete with the night
wind, the postman arrived like a deliverer. The postman
had to pass the dining-room <em>en route</em> by the circuitous drive
to the front door, and when dinner was afoot he would
hand the letters to the parlourmaid, who would divide
them into two portions, and, putting both on a salver,
offer the salver first to Mrs. and then to Mr. Spatt, while
Mr. or Mrs. Spatt begged guests, if there were any, to
excuse the quaint and indeed unusual custom, pardonable
only on the plea that any tidings from London ought to be
savoured instantly in such a place as Frinton.</p>

<p>After leaving his little pile untouched for some time,
Mr. Spatt took advantage of the diversion caused by the
brushing of the cloth and the distribution of finger-bowls to
glance at the topmost letter, which was addressed in a
woman&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming!&#8221; he exclaimed, forgetting to apologise
in the sudden excitement of news, &#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; He
looked at his watch. &#8220;She&#8217;s here. I heard the train
several minutes ago! She must be here! The letter&#8217;s
been delayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, Alroy?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Spatt earnestly. &#8220;Not
that Miss Nickall you mentioned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dove.&#8221; And then in a grave tone to the
parlourmaid: &#8220;Give this letter to your mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spatt, cheered by the new opportunity for conversation,
and in his eagerness abrogating all rules, explained
how he had been in London on the previous day for a performance
of Strauss&#8217;s <em>Elektra</em>, and according to his custom
had called at the offices of the Suffragette Union to see
whether he could in any manner aid the cause. He had
been told that a house in Paget Gardens lent to the Union
had been basely withdrawn from service by its owner on
account of some embroilment with the supreme police
authorities at Scotland Yard, and that one of the inmates,
a Miss Nickall, the poor young lady who had had her arm
broken and was scarcely convalescent, had need of quietude
and sea air. Mr. Spatt had instantly offered the hospitality
of his home to Miss Nickall, whom he had seen in a cab
and who was very sweet. Miss Nickall had said that she
must consult her companion. It now appeared that the companion
was gone to the Midlands. This episode had
occurred immediately before the receipt of the telegram from
head-quarters asking for shelter for Miss Jane Foley and
Mrs. Moncreiff.</p>

<p>Mr. Spatt&#8217;s excitement had now communicated itself
to everybody except Mr. Ziegler and Siegfried Spatt. Jane
Foley almost recovered her presence of mind, and Mrs.
Spatt was extraordinarily interested to learn that Miss
Nickall was an American painter who had lived long in
Paris, and that Audrey had first made her acquaintance in
Paris, and knew Paris well. Audrey&#8217;s motor-car had produced
a considerable impression on Aurora Spatt, and this
impression was deepened by the touch about Paris. After
breathing mysterious orders into the ear of the parlourmaid
Mrs. Spatt began to talk at large about music in
Paris, and Mr. Spatt made comparisons between the principal
opera houses in Europe. He proclaimed for the Scala at
Milan; but Mr. Ziegler, who had methodically according to
a fixed plan lived in all European capitals except Paris&mdash;whither
he was soon going, said that Mr. Spatt was quite
wrong, and that Milan could not hold a candle to Munich.
Mrs. Spatt inquired whether Audrey had heard Strauss&#8217;s
<em>Elektra</em> at the Paris Opera House. Audrey replied that
Strauss&#8217;s <em>Elektra</em> had not been given at the Paris Opera
House.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mrs. Spatt. &#8220;This prejudice against the
greatest modern masterpieces because they are German is
a very sad sign in Paris. I have noticed it for a long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey, who most irrationally had begun to be annoyed
by the blandness of Mr. Ziegler&#8217;s smile, answered with a
rival blandness:</p>

<p>&#8220;In Paris they do not reproach Strauss because he is
German, but because he is vulgar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Spatt had a martyrised expression. In her heart
she felt a sick trembling of her religious belief that <em>Elektra</em>
was the greatest opera ever composed. For Audrey had the
prestige of Paris and of the automobile. Mrs. Spatt, however,
said not a word. Mr. Ziegler, on the other hand,
after shuffling some seconds for utterance, ejaculated with
sublime anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;Vulgar!&#8221;</p>

<p>His rubicundity had increased and his blandness was
dissolved. A terrible sequel might have occurred, had not
the crunch of wheels on the drive been heard at that very
instant. The huge, dim form of a coach drawn by a ghostly
horse passed along towards the front door, just below the
diners. Almost simultaneously the electric light above the
front door was turned on, casting a glare across a section
of the inchoate garden, where no flower grew save the
dandelion. Everybody sprang up. Host and hostess,
urged by hospitality, spun first into the drive, and came
level with the vehicle precisely as the vehicle opened its
invisible interior. Jane Foley and Audrey saw Miss Nickall
emerge from it rather slowly and cautiously, with her white
kind face and her arm all swathed in white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Spatt,&#8221; came the American benevolent
voice of Nick. &#8220;How glad I am to see you. And this is
Mrs. Spatt? Mrs. Spatt! Delighted. Your husband is
the kindest, sweetest man, Mrs. Spatt, that I&#8217;ve met in
years. It is perfectly sweet of you to have me. I shouldn&#8217;t
have inflicted myself on you&mdash;no, I shouldn&#8217;t&mdash;only you
know we have to obey orders. I was told to come here,
and here I&#8217;ve come, with a glad heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was touched by the sight and voice of grey-haired
Nick, with her trick of seeing nothing but the best
in everybody, transforming everybody into saints, angels,
and geniuses. Her smiles and her tones were irresistible.
They were like the wand of some magical princess come to
break a sinister thrall. They nearly humanised the gaunt
parlourmaid, who stood grimly and primly waiting until
these tedious sentimental preliminaries should cease from
interfering with her duties in regard to the luggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have friends of yours here, Miss Nickall,&#8221;
simpered Mrs. Spatt, after she had given a welcome. She
had seen Jane Foley and Audrey standing expectant just
behind Mr. Spatt, and outside the field of the electric beam.</p>

<p>Nick glanced round, hesitated, and then with a sudden
change of all her features rushed at the girls regardless
of her arm. Her joy was enchanting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid&mdash;I was afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she murmured as she
kissed them. Her eyes softly glistened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, after a moment. &#8220;And I <em>have</em>
got a surprise for you! I have just! You may say it&#8217;s
some surprise.&#8221; She turned towards the cab. &#8220;Musa,
now do come out of that wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>And from the blackness of the cab&#8217;s interior gingerly
stepped Musa, holding a violin case in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Spatt,&#8221; said Nick. &#8220;Let me introduce Mr. Musa.
Mr. Musa is perhaps the greatest violinist in Paris&mdash;or
in Europe. Very old friend of ours. He came over to
London unexpectedly just as I was starting for Liverpool
Street station this afternoon. So I did the only thing
I could do. I couldn&#8217;t leave him there&mdash;I brought him
along, and we want Mr. Spatt to recommend us an hotel
in Frinton for him.&#8221; And while Musa was shyly in his
imperfect English greeting Mr. and Mrs. Spatt, she whispered
to Audrey: &#8220;You don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;d never guess.
A big concert agent in Paris has taken him up at last.
He&#8217;s going to play at a lot of concerts, and they actually
paid him two thousand five hundred francs in advance.
Isn&#8217;t it a perfect dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey, who had seen Musa&#8217;s trustful glance at Nick
as he descended from the cab, was suddenly aware of
a fierce pang of hate for the benignant Nick, and a
wave of fury against Musa. The thing was very disconcerting.</p>

<p>After self-conscious greetings, Musa almost dragged
Audrey away from the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you I came to London to see,&#8221; he muttered in
an unusual voice.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_25" id="chapter_25" />CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>THE MUTE</h3>


<p>It was upon this evening that Audrey began alarmingly
to develop the quality of being incomprehensible&mdash;even to
herself. Like most young women and men, she had been
convinced from an early age that she was mysteriously
unlike all other created beings, and&mdash;again like most young
men and women&mdash;she could find, in the secrecy of her
own heart, plenty of proof of a unique strangeness. But
now her unreason became formidable. There she sat with
her striking forehead and her quite unimportant nose, in
the large austere drawing-room of the Spatts, which was
so pervaded by artistic chintz that the slightest movement
in it produced a crackle&mdash;and wondered why she was so
much queerer than other girls could possibly be.</p>

<p>Neither the crackling of chintz nor the aspect of the
faces in the drawing-room was conducive to clear psychological
analysis. Mr. Ziegler, with a glass of Pilsener
by his side on a small table and a cigar in his richly
jewelled hand, reposed with crossed legs in an easy chair.
He had utterly recovered from the momentary irritation
caused by Audrey&#8217;s attack on Strauss, and his perfect
beaming satisfaction with himself made a spectacle which
would have distracted an Indian saint from the contemplation
of eternity and nothingness. Mr. and Mrs. Spatt,
seated as far as was convenient from one another on a
long sofa, their emaciated bodies very upright and alert,
gazed with intense expectation at Musa. Musa stood in
the middle of the room, tuning his violin with little twangs
and listening to the twangs as to a secret message.</p>

<p>Miss Nickall, being an invalid, had excusably gone to
bed, and Jane Foley, sharer of her bedroom, had followed.
The happy relief on Jane&#8217;s face as she said good night
to her hosts had testified to the severity of the ordeal of
hospitality through which she had so heroically passed.
She might have been going out of prison instead of going
out of the most intellectual drawing-room in Frinton.</p>

<p>Audrey, too, would have liked to retire, for automobiles
and sensations had exhausted her; but just at this point
her unreason had begun to operate. She would not leave
Musa alone, because Miss Nickall was leaving him alone.
Yet she did not feel at all benevolent towards Musa. She
was angry with him for having quitted Paris. She was
angry with him for having said to her, in such a peculiar
tone: &#8220;It&#8217;s you I came to London to see.&#8221; She was angry
with him for not having found an opportunity, during the
picnic meal provided for the two new-comers after the
regular dinner, to explain why he had come to London
to see her. She was angry with him for that dark hostility
which he had at once displayed towards Mr. Ziegler,
though she herself hated the innocent Mr. Ziegler with
the ferocity of a woman of the Revolution. And further,
she was glad, ridiculously glad, that Musa had come to
London to see her. Lastly she was aware of a most
irrational objection to the manner in which Miss Nickall
and Musa said good night to one another, and the obvious
fact that Musa in less than an hour had reached terms of
familiarity with Jane Foley.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea why he has given up his
practising in Paris to come to see me. But if it is what
I feel sure it is, there will be trouble.... Why do I
stay in this ghastly drawing-room? I am dying to go to
sleep, and I simply detest everybody in the room. I detest
Musa more than all, because as usual he has been acting
like a child.... Why can&#8217;t you smile at him, Audrey
Moze? Why frown and pretend you&#8217;re cross when you
know you aren&#8217;t, Audrey Moze? ... I am cross, and
he shall suffer. Was this a time to leave his practising&mdash;and
the concerts soon coming on? I positively prefer this
Ziegler man to him. Yes, I do.&#8221; So ran her reflections,
and they annoyed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you wish me to play?&#8221; asked Musa,
when he had definitely finished twanging. Audrey noticed
that his English accent was getting a little less French.
She had to admit that, though his appearance was extravagantly
un-British, it was distinguished. The immensity
of his black silk cravat made the black cravat of Mr. Spatt
seem like a bootlace round his thin neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever you like, Mr. Musa,&#8221; replied Aurora Spatt.
&#8220;<em>Please!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>And as a fact the excellent woman, majestic now in
spite of her red nose and her excessive thinness, did not
care what Musa played. He had merely to play. She
had decided for herself, from the conversation, that he
was a very celebrated performer, and she had ascertained,
by direct questioning, that he had never performed in
England. She was determined to be able to say to all
comers till death took her that &#8220;Musa&mdash;the great Musa,
you know&mdash;first played in England in my own humble
drawing-room.&#8221; The thing itself was actually about to
occur; nothing could stop it from occurring; and the thought
of the immediate realisation of her desire and ambition
gave Mrs. Spatt greater and more real pleasure than she
had had for years; it even fortified her against the possible
resentment of her cherished Mr. Ziegler.</p>

<p>&#8220;French music&mdash;would you wish?&#8221; Musa suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any French music? That is to say, of artistic
importance?&#8221; asked Mr. Ziegler calmly. &#8220;I have never
heard of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not consciously being rude. Nor was he trying
to be funny. His question implied an honest belief. His
assertion was sincere. He glanced, blinking slightly, round
the room, with a self-confidence that was either terrible
or pathetic, according to the degree of your own self-confidence.</p>

<p>Audrey said to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad this isn&#8217;t my drawing-room.&#8221; And she was
almost frightened by the thought that that skull opposite
to her was absolutely impenetrable, and that it would
go down to the grave unpierced with all its collection of
ideas intact and braggart.</p>

<p>As for Mr. and Mrs. Spatt they were both in the
state of not knowing where to look. Immediately their
gaze met another gaze it leapt away as from something
dangerous or obscene.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will play Debussy&#8217;s Toccata for violin solo,&#8221; Musa
announced tersely. He had blushed; his great eyes were
sparkling. And he began to play.</p>

<p>And as soon as he had played a few bars, Audrey
gave a start, fortunately not a physical start, and she
blushed also. Musa sternly winked at her. Frenchmen
do not make a practice of winking, but he had learnt the
accomplishment for fun from Miss Thompkins in Paris.
The wink caused Audrey surreptitiously to observe Mr.
and Mrs. Spatt. It was no relief to her to perceive that
these two were listening to Debussy&#8217;s Toccata for solo
violin with the trained and appreciative attention of people
who had heard it often before in the various capitals of
Europe, who knew it by heart, and who knew at just what
passages to raise the head, to give a nod of recognition
or a gesture of ecstasy. The bare room was filled with
the sound of Musa&#8217;s fiddle and with the high musical
culture of Mr. and Mrs. Spatt. When the piece was over
they clapped discreetly, and looked with soft intensity at
Audrey, as if murmuring: &#8220;You, too, are a cultured
cosmopolitan. You share our emotion.&#8221; And across the
face of Mrs. Spatt spread a glow triumphant, for Musa
now positively had played for the first time in England in
her drawing-room, and she foresaw hundreds of occasions
on which she could refer to the matter with a fitting air of
casualness. The glow triumphant, however, paled somewhat
as she felt upon herself the eye of Mr. Ziegler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Siegfried, Alroy?&#8221; she demanded, after
having thanked Musa. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have had him miss
that Debussy for anything, but I hadn&#8217;t noticed that he
was gone. He adores Debussy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is like bad Bach,&#8221; Mr. Ziegler put in
suddenly. Then he raised his glass and imbibed a good
portion of the beer specially obtained and provided for
him by his hostess and admirer, Mrs. Spatt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you <em>really</em>?&#8221; murmured Mrs. Spatt, with deprecation.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in the comparison,&#8221; Mr. Spatt
admitted thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not like good Bach?&#8221; Musa asked, glaring in
a very strange manner at Mr. Ziegler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Ziegler with a most notable
imperturbability. &#8220;Only Bach himself could com-pose good
Bach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa&#8217;s breathing could be heard across the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Eh bien!</em>&#8220; said Musa. &#8220;Now I will play for you
Debussy&#8217;s Toccata. I was not playing it before. I was
playing the Chaconne of Bach, the most famous composition
for the violin in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not embroider the statement. He left it in its
nakedness. Nor did he permit anybody else to embroider
it. Before a word of any kind could be uttered he had
begun to play again. Probably in all the annals of artistic
snobbery, no cultured cosmopolitan had ever been made
to suffer a more exquisite moral torture of humiliation
than Musa had contrived to inflict upon Mr. and Mrs.
Spatt in return for their hospitality. Their sneaped
squirmings upon the sofa were terrible to witness. But
Mr. Ziegler&#8217;s sensibility was apparently quite unaffected.
He continued to smile, to drink, and to smoke. He seemed
to be saying to himself: &#8220;What does it matter to me that
this miserable Frenchman has caught me in a mistake?
I could eat him, and one day I shall eat him.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little while Musa snatched out of his right-hand
lower waistcoat pocket the tiny wooden &#8220;mute&#8221;
which all violinists carry without fail upon all occasions
in all their waistcoats; and, sticking it with marvellous
rapidity upon the bridge of the violin, he entered upon a
pianissimo, but still lively, episode of the Toccata. And
simultaneously another melody faint and clear could be
heard in the room. It was Mr. Ziegler humming &#8220;The
Watch on the Rhine&#8221; against the Toccata of Debussy.
Thus did it occur to Mr. Ziegler to take revenge on Musa
for having attempted to humiliate him. Not unsurprisingly,
Musa detected at once the competitive air. He continued
to play, gazing hard at his violin and apparently entranced,
but edging little by little towards Mr. Ziegler. Audrey
desired either to give a cry or to run out of the room.
She did neither, being held to inaction by the spell of Mr.
Ziegler&#8217;s perfect unconcern as, with the beer glass lifted
towards his mouth, he proceeded steadily to work through
&#8220;The Watch on the Rhine,&#8221; while Musa lilted out the
delicate, gay phrases of Debussy. The enchantment upon
the whole room was sinister and painful. Musa got closer
to Mr. Ziegler, who did not blench nor cease from his
humming. Then suddenly Musa, lowering his fiddle and
interrupting the scene, snatched the mute from the bridge
of the violin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have put it on the wrong instrument,&#8221; he said thickly,
with a very French intonation, and simultaneously he
shoved the mute with violence into the mouth of Mr.
Ziegler. In doing so, he jerked up Mr. Ziegler&#8217;s elbow,
and the remains of the beer flew up and baptised Mr.
Ziegler&#8217;s face and vesture. Then he jammed the violin
into its case, and ran out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Barbare! Imbécile! Sauvage!</em>&#8220; he muttered ferociously
on the threshold.</p>

<p>The enchantment was broken. Everybody rose, and not
the least precipitately the streaming Mr. Ziegler, who, ejecting
the mute with much spluttering, and pitching away his
empty glass, sprang towards the door, with justifiable
homicide in every movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ziegler!&#8221; Audrey appealed to him, snatching at
his dress-coat and sticking to it.</p>

<p>He turned, furious, his face still dripping the finest
Pilsener beer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your dress-coat is not wiped instantly, it will be
ruined,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Ach! Meiner Frack!</em>&#8220; exclaimed Mr. Ziegler, forgetting
his deep knowledge of English. His economic
instincts had been swiftly aroused, and they dominated all
the other instincts. &#8220;<em>Meiner Frack!</em> Vill you vipe it?&#8221;
His glance was imploring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mrs. Spatt will attend to it,&#8221; said Audrey with
solemnity, and walked out of the room into the hall. There
was not a sign of Musa; the disappearance of the violinist
was disquieting; and yet it made her glad&mdash;so much so
that she laughed aloud. A few moments later Mr. Ziegler
stalked forth from the house which he was never to enter
again, and his silent scorn and the grandeur of his displeasure
were terrific. He entirely ignored Audrey, who had
nevertheless been the means of saving his <em>Frack</em> for him.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_26" id="chapter_26" />CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>NOCTURNE</h3>


<p>Soon afterwards Audrey, who had put on a hat, went out
with Mr. Spatt to look for Musa. Not until shortly before
the musical performance had the Spatts succeeded in persuading
Musa to &#8220;accept their hospitality for the night.&#8221;
(The phrase was their own. They were incapable of saying
&#8220;Let us put you up.") Meanwhile his bag had been left in
the hall. This bag had now vanished. The parlourmaid,
questioned, said frigidly that she had not touched it because
she had received no orders to touch it. Musa himself must
therefore have removed it. With bag in one hand and
fiddle case in the other, he must have fled, relinquishing
nothing but the mute in his flight. He knew naught of
England, naught of Frinton, and he was the least practical
creature alive. Hence Audrey, who was in essence his
mother, and who knew Frinton as some people know London,
had said that she would go and look for him. Mr.
Spatt, ever chivalrous, had impulsively offered to accompany
her. He could indeed do no less. Mrs. Spatt, overwhelmed
by the tragic sequel to her innocent triumphant, had retired
to the first floor.</p>

<p>The wind blew, and it was very dark, as Audrey and
her squire passed along Third Avenue to the front. They
did not converse&mdash;they were both too shy, too impressed by
the peculiarity of the predicament. They simply peered.
They peered everywhere for the truant form of Musa
balanced on one side by a bag and on the other by a fiddle
case. From the trim houses, each without exception new,
twinkled discreet lights, with glimpses of surpassingly
correct domesticity, and the wind rustled loudly through the
foliage of the prim gardens, ruffling them as it might have
ruffled the unwilling hair of the daughters of an arch-deacon.
Nobody was abroad. Absurd thoughts ran
through Audrey&#8217;s head. A letter from Mr. Foulger had
followed her to Birmingham, and in the letter Mr. Foulger
had acquainted her with the fact that Great Mexican Oil
shares had just risen to £2 3s. apiece. She knew that she
had 180,000 of them, and now under the thin protection of
Mr. Spatt she tried to reckon 180,000 times £2 3s. She
could not do the sum. At any rate she could not be sure
that she did it correctly. However, she was fairly well convinced
beneath the dark, impenetrable sky that the answer
totalled nearly £400,000, that was, ten million francs.
And the ridiculousness of an heiress who owned over ten
million francs wandering about a place like Frinton with a
man like Mr. Spatt, searching for another man like Musa,
struck her as exceeding the bounds of the permissible. She
considered that she ought to have been in a magnificent
drawing-room of her own in Park Lane or the Avenue du
Bois de Boulogne, welcoming counts, princes, duchesses,
diplomats and self-possessed geniuses of finished manners,
with witty phrase that displayed familiarity with all that
was profoundest and most brilliant in European civilisation.
Life seemed to be disappointing her, and assuredly money
was not the thing that she had imagined it to be.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;If this walking lamp-post does not say something soon
I shall scream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Spatt said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be blowing up for rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>She screamed in the silent solitude of Frinton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; she apologised quickly. &#8220;I thought I
saw something move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One does,&#8221; faltered Mr. Spatt.</p>

<p>They were now in the shopping street, where in the
mornings the elect encounter each other on expeditions to
purchase bridge-markers, chocolate, bathing costumes and
tennis balls. It was a black and empty canyon through
which the wind raced.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be down&mdash;down on the shore,&#8221; Mr. Spatt
timidly suggested. He seemed to be suggesting suicide.</p>

<p>They turned and descended across the Greensward to
the shore, which was lined with hundreds of bathing huts,
each christened with a name, and each deserted, for the
by-laws of the Frinton Urban District Council judiciously
forbade that the huts should be used as sleeping-chambers.
The tide was very low. They walked over the wide flat
sands, and came at length to the sea&#8217;s roar, the white
tumbling of foamy breakers, and the full force of the south-east
wind. Across the invisible expanse of water could be
discerned the beam of a lightship. And Audrey was aware
of mysterious sensations such as she had not had since she
inhabited Flank Hall and used to steal out at nights to
watch the estuary. And she thought solemnly: &#8220;Musa is
somewhere near, existing.&#8221; And then she thought: &#8220;What
a silly thought! Of course he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see somebody coming!&#8221; Mr. Spatt burst out in a
dramatic whisper. But the precaution of whispering was
useless, because the next instant, in spite of himself, he
loudly sneezed.</p>

<p>And about two hundred yards off on the sands Audrey
made out a moving figure, which at that distance did in
fact seem to have vague appendages that might have resembled
a bag and a fiddle case. But the atmosphere of
the night was deceptive, and the figure as it approached
resolved itself into three figures&mdash;a black one in the middle
of two white ones. A girl&#8217;s coarse laugh came down the
wind. It could not conceivably have been the laugh of any
girl who went into the shopping street to buy bridge-markers,
chocolate, bathing costumes or tennis balls. But
it might have been&mdash;it not improbably was&mdash;the laugh of
some girl whose mission was to sell such things. The trio
meandered past, heedless. Mr. Spatt said no word, but he
appreciably winced. The black figure in the midst of the
two white ones was that of his son Siegfried, reputedly so
fond of Debussy. As the group receded and faded, a fragment
of a music-hall song floated away from it into the
firmament.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not much use looking any longer,&#8221; said
Mr. Spatt weakly. &#8220;He&mdash;he may have gone back to the
house. Let us hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the chief garden gate of the Spatt residence they
came upon Miss Nickall, trying to open it. The sling
round her arm made her unmistakable. And Miss Nickall
having allowed them to recover from a pardonable astonishment
at the sight of her who was supposed to be exhausted
and in bed, said cheerfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found him, and I&#8217;ve put him up at the Excelsior
Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Spatt had related the terrible episode to her guest,
who had wilfully risen at once. Miss Nickall had had luck,
but Audrey had to admit that these American girls were
stupendously equal to an emergency. And she hated the
angelic Nick for having found Musa.</p>

<p>&#8220;We tried first to find a café,&#8221; said Nick. &#8220;But there
aren&#8217;t any in this city. What do you call them in England&mdash;public-houses,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Mr. Spatt in a shaking voice. &#8220;Public-houses
are not permitted in Frinton, I am glad to say.&#8221; And
he began to form an intention, subject to Aurora&#8217;s approval,
to withdraw altogether from the suffrage movement, which
appeared to him to be getting out of hand.</p>

<p>As they were all separating for the night Audrey and
Nick hesitated for a moment in front of each other, and
then they kissed with a quite unusual effusiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really liked her,&#8221; said Audrey
to herself.</p>

<p>What Nick said to herself is lost to history.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_27" id="chapter_27" />CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>IN THE GARDEN</h3>


<p>The next morning, after a night spent chiefly in thought,
Audrey issued forth rather early. Indeed she was probably
the first person afoot in the house of the Spatts, the parlour-maid
entering the hall just as Audrey had managed to open
the front door. As the parlour-maid was obviously not yet
in that fullness and spruceness of attire which parlour-maids
affect when performing their mission in life, Audrey decided
to offer no remark, explanatory or otherwise, and passed
into the garden with nonchalance as though her invariable
habit when staying in strange houses was to get up before
anybody else and spy out the whole property while the
helpless hosts were yet in bed and asleep.</p>

<p>Now it was a magnificent morning: no wind, no cloud,
and the sun rising over the sea; not a trace of the previous
evening&#8217;s weather. Audrey had not been in the leafy street
more than a moment when she forgot that she was tired
and short of sleep, and also very worried by affairs both
private and public. Her body responded to the sun, and
her mind also. She felt almost magically healthy, strong
and mettlesome, and, further, she began to feel happy; she
rather blamed herself for this tendency to feel happy, calling
herself heedless and indifferent. She did not understand
what it is to be young. She had risen partly because of the
futility of bed, but more because of a desire to inspect again
her own part of the world after the unprecedented absence
from it.</p>

<p>Frinton was within the borders of her own part of the
world, and, though she now regarded it with the condescending
eyes of a Parisian and Londoner, she found pleasure in
looking upon it and in recognising old landmarks and recent
innovations. She saw, on the Greensward separating the
promenade from the beach, that a rustic seat had been
elaborately built by the Council round the great trunk of the
only tree in Frinton; and she decided that there had been
questionable changes since her time. And in this way she
went on. However, the splendour and reality of the sun,
making such an overwhelming contrast with the insubstantial
phenomena of the gloomy night, prevented undue
cerebral activity. She reflected that Frinton on a dark night
and Frinton on a bright morning were not like the same
place, and she left it at that, and gazed at the façade of the
Excelsior Hotel, wondering for an instant why she should be
interested in it, and then looking swiftly away.</p>

<p>She had to glance at all the shops, though none of
them was open except the dairy-shop; and in the shopping
street, which had a sunrise at one end and the
railway station at the other, she lit on the new palatial
garage.</p>

<p>&#8220;My car may be in there,&#8221; she thought.</p>

<p>After the manner of most car-owners on tour, she had
allowed the chauffeur to disappear with the car in the
evening where he listed, confident that the next morning
he and it would reappear cleansed and in good running
order.</p>

<p>The car was in the garage, almost solitary on a floor
of asphalt under a glass roof. An untidy youth, with the
end of a cigarette clinging to his upper lip in a way to
suggest that it had clung there throughout the night and
was the last vestige of a jollification, seemed to be dragging
a length of hose from a hydrant towards the car, the while
his eyes rested on a large notice: &#8220;Smoking absolutely
prohibited. By order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then from the other extremity of the garage came a
jaunty, dapper, quasi-martial figure, in a new grey uniform,
with a peaked grey cap, bright brown leggings, and bright
brown boots to match&mdash;the whole highly brushed, polished,
smooth and glittering. This being pulled out of his pocket
a superb pair of kid gloves, then a silver cigarette-case, and
then a silver match-box, and he ignited a cigarette&mdash;the
unrivalled, wondrous first cigarette of the day&mdash;casting down
the match with a large, free gesture. At sight of him the
untidy youth grew more active.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look &#8217;ere,&#8221; said the being to the youth, &#8220;what the &#8217;ell
time did I tell you to have that car cleaned by, and you
not begun it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pointing to the clock, he lounged magnificently to and
fro, spreading smoke around the intimidated and now industrious
youth. The next second he caught sight of
Audrey, and transformed himself instantaneously into what
she had hitherto imagined a chauffeur always was; but in
those few moments she had learnt that the essence of a
chauffeur is godlike, and that he toils not, neither does
he swab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, madam,&#8221; in a soft, courtly voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you wanting the car, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not, but the suggestion gave her an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we take it as it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam. I&#8217;ll just look at the petrol gauge ...
But ... I haven&#8217;t had my breakfast, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time do you have it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, madam, when you have yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, then. You&#8217;ve got hours yet. I want
you to take me to Flank Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flank Hall, madam?&#8221; His tone expressed the fact
that his mind was a blank as to Flank Hall.</p>

<p>As soon as Audrey had comprehended that the situation
of Flank Hall was not necessarily known to every chauffeur
in England, and that a stay of one night in Frinton might
not have been enough to familiarise this particular one with
the geography of the entire district, she replied that she
would direct him.</p>

<p>They were held up by a train at the railway crossing,
and a milk-cart and a young pedestrian were also held up.
When Audrey identified the pedestrian she wished momentarily
that she had not set out on the expedition. Then
she said to herself that really it did not matter, and why
should she be afraid ... etc., etc. The pedestrian was
Musa. In French they greeted each other stiffly, like
distant acquaintances, and the train thundered past.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was taking the air, simply, Madame,&#8221; said Musa,
with his ingenuous shy smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it in my car,&#8221; said Audrey with a sudden resolve.
&#8220;In one hour at the latest we shall have returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had a great deal to say to him and a great deal
to listen to, and there could not possibly be any occasion
equal to the present, which was ideal.</p>

<p>He got in; the chauffeur manoeuvred to oust the milk-cart
from its rightful precedence, the gates opened, and the
car swung at gathering speed into the well-remembered road
to Moze. And the two passengers said nothing to each
other of the slightest import. Musa&#8217;s escape from Paris
was between them; the unimaginable episode at the Spatts
was between them; the sleepless night was between them.
(And had she not saved him by her presence of mind from
the murderous hand of Mr. Ziegler?) They had a million
things to impart. And yet naught was uttered save a few
banalities about the weather and about the healthfulness of
being up early. They were bashful, constrained, altogether
too young and inexperienced. They wanted to behave in
the grand, social, easeful manner of a celebrated public performer
and an heiress worth ten million francs. And they
could only succeed in being a boy and a girl. The chauffeur
alone, at from thirty to forty miles an hour, was worthy of
himself and his high vocation. Both the passengers regretted
that they had left their beds. Happily the car
laughed at the alleged distance between Frinton and Moze.
In a few minutes, as it seemed, with but one false turning,
due to the impetuosity of the chauffeur, the vehicle drew
up before the gates of Flank Hall. Audrey had avoided
the village of Moze. The passengers descended.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my house,&#8221; Audrey murmured.</p>

<p>The gates were shut but not locked. They creaked as
Audrey pushed against them. The drive was covered with
a soft film of green, as though it were gradually being
entombed in the past. The young roses, however, belonged
emphatically to the present. Dewdrops hung from them
like jewels, and their odour filled the air. Audrey turned
off the main drive towards the garden front of the house,
which had always been the aspect that she preferred, and
at the same moment she saw the house windows and the
thrilling perspective of Mozewater. One of the windows
was open. She was glad, because this proved that the
perfect Aguilar, gardener and caretaker, was after all
imperfect. It was his crusty perfection that had ever set
Audrey, and others, against Aguilar. But he had gone to
bed and forgotten a window&mdash;and it was the French
window. While, in her suddenly revived character of a
harsh Essex inhabitant, she was thinking of some sarcastic
word to say to Aguilar about the window, another window
slowly opened from within, and Aguilar&#8217;s head became
visible. Once more he had exasperatingly proved his perfection.
He had not gone to bed and forgotten a window.
But he had risen with exemplary earliness to give air to
the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;d mornin&#8217;, miss,&#8221; mumbled the unsmiling Aguilar,
impassively, as though Audrey had never been away from
Moze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Aguilar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect ye so early, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could you be expecting me at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ingate come home yesterday. She said you
couldn&#8217;t be far off, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Miss ... <em>Mrs.</em>&mdash;Moncreiff,&#8221; said Audrey firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, madam,&#8221; Aguilar responded with absolute
imperturbability. &#8220;She never said nothing about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he proceeded mechanically to the next window.</p>

<p>The yard-dog began to bark. Audrey, ignoring Musa,
went round the shrubbery towards the kennel. The
chained dog continued to bark, furiously, until Audrey was
within six feet of him, and then he crouched and squirmed
and gave low whines and his tail wagged with extreme
rapidity. Audrey bent down, trembling.... She could
scarcely see.... There was something about the green
film on the drive, about the look of the house, about the
sheeted drawing-room glimpsed through the open window,
about the view of Mozewater...! She felt acutely and
painfully sorry for, and yet envious of, the young girl in a
plain blue frock who used to haunt the house and the
garden, and who had somehow made the house and the
garden holy for evermore by her unhappiness and her longings....
Audrey was crying.... She heard a step and
stood upright. It was Musa&#8217;s step.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen you so exquisite,&#8221; said Musa in a
murmur subdued and yet enthusiastic. All his faculties
seemed to be dwelling reflectively upon her with passionate
appreciation.</p>

<p>They had at last begun to talk, really&mdash;he in French, and
she partly in French and partly in English. It was her
tears, or perhaps her gesture in trying to master them, that
had loosed their tongues. The ancient dog was forgotten,
and could not understand why. Audrey was excusably
startled by Musa&#8217;s words and tone, and by the sudden change
in his attitude. She thought that his personal distinction
at the moment was different from and superior to any other
in her experience. She had a comfortable feeling of condescension
towards Nick and towards Jane Foley. And
at the same time she blamed Musa, perceiving that as usual
he was behaving like a child who cannot grasp the great
fact that life is very serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s all very fine, that is. You
pretend this, that, and the other. But why are you here?
Why aren&#8217;t you at work in Paris? You&#8217;ve got the chance
of a lifetime, and instead of staying at home and
practising hard and preparing yourself, you come gadding
over to England simply because there&#8217;s a bit of money in
your pocket!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was very young, and in the splendour of the
magnificent morning she looked the emblem of simplicity;
but in her heart she was his mother, his sole fount of
wisdom and energy and shrewdness.</p>

<p>Pain showed in his sensitive features, and then appeal,
and then a hot determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came because I could not work,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you couldn&#8217;t work? Why couldn&#8217;t you
work?&#8221; There was no yielding in her hard voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know! I don&#8217;t know! I suppose it is because
you are not there, because you have made yourself
necessary to me; or,&#8221; he corrected quickly, &#8220;because <em>I</em>
have made you necessary to myself. Oh! I can practise
for so many hours per day. But it is useless. It is not
authentic practice. I think not of the music. It is as if
some other person was playing, with my arm, on my violin.
I am not there. I am with you, where you are. It is the
same day after day, every day, every day. I am done for.
I am convinced that I am done for. These concerts will
infallibly be my ruin, and I shall be shamed before all Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you come to England to tell me this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was relieved, for she had thought of another explanation
of his escapade, and had that explanation proved
to be the true one, she was very ready to make unpleasantness
to the best of her ability. Nevertheless, though
relieved in one direction, she was gravely worried in another.
She had undertaken the job of setting Musa grandiosely
on his artistic career, and the difficulties of it were growing
more and more complex and redoubtable.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you seemed so jolly when you arrived last night.
Nobody would have guessed you had a care in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not,&#8221; he replied eagerly, &#8220;as soon as I saw you.
The surprise of seeing you&mdash;it was that.... And you left
Paris without saying good-bye! Why did you leave Paris
without saying good-bye? Never since the moment when
I learnt that you had gone have I had the soul to practise.
My violin became a wooden box; my fingers, too, were of
wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped. The dog sniffed round.</p>

<p>Audrey was melting in bliss. She could feel herself
dissolving. Her pleasure was terrible. It was true that
she had left Paris without saying good-bye to Musa. She
had done it on purpose. Why? She did not know.
Perhaps out of naughtiness, perhaps.... She was aware
that she could be hard, like her father. But she was glad,
intensely glad, that she had left Paris so, because the result
had been this avowal. She, Audrey, little Audrey, scarcely
yet convinced that she was grown up, was necessary to the
genius whom all the Quarter worshipped! Miss Thompkins
was not necessary to him, Miss Nickall was not necessary
to him, though both had helped to provide the means to
keep him alive. She herself alone was necessary to him.
And she had not guessed it. She had not even hoped for
it. The effect of her personality upon Musa was mysterious&mdash;she
did not affect to understand it&mdash;but it was obviously
real and it was vital. If anything in the world could surpass
the pleasure, her pride surpassed it. All tears were forgotten.
She was the proudest young woman in the world;
and she was the wisest, and the most harassed, too. But the
anxieties were delicious to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am essential to him,&#8221; she thought ecstatically. &#8220;I
stand between him and disaster. When he has succeeded
his success will be my work and nobody else&#8217;s. I have a
mission. I must live for it.... If anyone had told me
a year ago that a great French genius would be absolutely
dependent upon me, and that I meant for him all the
difference between failure and triumph, I should have
laughed.... And yet!...&#8221; She looked at him surreptitiously.
&#8220;He&#8217;s an angel. But he&#8217;s also a baby.&#8221; The
feelings of motherhood were as naught compared to hers.</p>

<p>Then she remarked harshly, icily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shall be much obliged if you will go back to
Paris at once&mdash;to-day. <em>Somebody</em> must have a little sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at this point Aguilar interrupted. He came slouching
round the corner of the clipped bushes, untidy, shabby,
implacable, with some set purpose in his hard blue eyes.
She could have annihilated him with satisfaction, but the
fellow was indestructible as well as implacable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I have a word with ye, madam?&#8221; he mumbled,
putting on his well-known air of chicane.</p>

<p>With the unexplained Musa close by her she could not
answer: &#8220;Wait a little. I&#8217;m engaged.&#8221; She had to be
careful. She had to make out especially that she and the
young man were up to nothing in particular, nothing that
had the slightest importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Aguilar?&#8221; she questioned, inimically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s down here,&#8221; said Aguilar, who recked not of the
implications of a tone. And by the mere force of his glance
he drew his mistress away, out of sight of Musa and the
dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that your motor-car at the gates, madam?&#8221; he
demanded gloomily and confidentially, his gaze now fixed
on the ground or on his patched boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right then,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I thought it
might belong to another person, and I had to make sure.
Now if ye&#8217;ll just step along a bit farther, I&#8217;ve a little thing
as I want to point out to ye, madam. It&#8217;s my duty to point
it out, let others say <em>what</em> they will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked ahead doggedly, and Audrey crossly came
after, until they arrived nearly at the end of the hedge
which, separating the upper from the lower garden, hid
from those immediately behind it all view of the estuary.
Here, still sheltered by the hedge, he stopped and Audrey
stopped, and Aguilar absently plucked up a young plantain
from the turf and dropped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a man a-hanging round this place since
yesterday mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said Aguilar intimately. &#8220;I call him a
suspicious character&mdash;at least, I <em>did</em>, till last night. He
ain&#8217;t slept in the village, that I do know, but he&#8217;s about
again this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Audrey with impatience. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
tell Inspector Keeble? Or have you quarrelled with
Inspector Keeble again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that as would ha&#8217; stopped me from acquainting
Inspector Keeble with the circumstances if I thought
it my duty so to do,&#8221; replied Aguilar. &#8220;But the fact is I
saw the chap talking to Inspector Keeble yesterday evening.
He don&#8217;t know as I saw him. It was that as made me
think; now is he a suspicious character or ain&#8217;t he? Of
course Keeble&#8217;s a rare simple-minded &#8217;un, as we all know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might like to have a look at him yeself,
madam. And if you&#8217;ll just peep round the end of this hedge
casual-like, ye&#8217;ll see him walking across the salting from
Lousey Hard. He&#8217;s a-comin&#8217; this way. Casual-like now&mdash;and
he won&#8217;t see ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey had to obey. She peeped casual-like, and she
did in fact see a man on the salting, and this man was
getting nearer. She could see him very plainly in the
brilliant clearness of the summer morning. After the
shortest instant of hesitation she recognised him beyond
any doubt. It was the detective who had been so
plenteously baptised by Susan Foley in the area of the house
at Paget Gardens. Aguilar looked at Audrey, and Audrey
annoyed herself somewhat by blushing. However, an agreeable
elation quickly overcame the blush.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_28" id="chapter_28" />CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>ENCOUNTER</h3>


<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; Audrey cried, very gaily, to the still
advancing detective, who, after the slightest hesitation in
the world, responded gaily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s accent struck her. She said to herself, with
amusement:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Irish!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey had left the astonished but dispassionate gardener
at the hedge, and was now emerging from the scanty and
dishevelled plantation close to the boundary wall of the
estate. She supposed that the police must have been on her
track and on the track of Jane Foley, and that by some
mysterious skill they had hunted her down. But she did
not care. She was not in the least afraid. The sudden
vision of a jail did not affright her. On the contrary her
chief sensation was one of joyous self-confidence, which
sensation had been produced in her by the remarks and the
attitude of Musa. She had always known that she was both
shy and adventurous, and that the two qualities were
mutually contradictory; but now it appeared to her that
diffidence had been destroyed, and that that change which
she had ever longed for in her constitution had at least
really come to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very surprised to see me,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, madam,&#8221; said the detective, &#8220;I&#8217;m not paid to
be surprised&mdash;in my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had raised his hat. He was standing on the dyke,
and from that height he looked somewhat down upon
Audrey leaning against the wall. The watercourse and the
strip of eternally emerald-green grass separated them.
Though neither tall nor particularly handsome, he was a
personable man, with a ready smile and alert, agile movements.
Audrey was too far off to judge of his eyes, but
she was quite sure that they twinkled. The contrast
between this smart, cheerful fellow and the half-drowned
victim in the area of the house in Paget Gardens was quite
acute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve a good mind to hold a meeting for your
benefit,&#8221; said Audrey, striving to recall the proper phrases
of propaganda which she had heard in the proper quarters
in London during her brief connection with the cause.
However, she could not recall them, &#8220;But there&#8217;s no need
to,&#8221; she added. &#8220;A gentleman of your intelligence must be
of our way of thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the vote, of course. And so your conduct is all
the more shocking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; he exclaimed, laughing. &#8220;If it comes to that,
your own sex is against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey had heard this argument before, and it had the
same effect on her as on most other stalwarts of the new
political creed. It annoyed her, because there was something
in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The vast majority of women are with us,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your wife isn&#8217;t the vast majority of women,&#8221;
Audrey protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, she is,&#8221; said the detective, &#8220;so far as I&#8217;m
concerned. Every wife is, so far as her husband is concerned.
Sure, you ought to know that!&#8221; In his Irish
way he doubled the &#8220;r&#8221; of the word &#8220;sure,&#8221; and somehow
this trick made Audrey like him still more. &#8220;My wife
believes,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;that woman&#8217;s sphere is the
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>("His wife is stout,&#8221; Audrey decided within herself, on
no grounds whatever. &#8220;If she wasn&#8217;t, she couldn&#8217;t be a
vast majority.")</p>

<p>Aloud she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, why can&#8217;t you leave them alone in their
sphere, instead of worrying them and spying on them down
areas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye mean at Paget Gardens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t professional&mdash;if
you&#8217;ll excuse me being so frank. That was just due to
human admiration. It&#8217;s not illegal to admire a young
woman, I suppose, even if she is a suffragette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What young woman are you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Susan Foley, of course. I won&#8217;t tell you what
I think of her, in spite of all she did, because I&#8217;ve learnt
that it&#8217;s a mistake to praise one woman to another. But
I don&#8217;t mind admitting that her going off to the north has
made me life a blank. If I&#8217;d thought she&#8217;d go, I should
never have reported the affair at the Yard. But I was
annoyed, and I&#8217;m rather hasty.&#8221; He paused, and ended
reflectively: &#8220;I committed follies to get a word with the
young lady, and I didn&#8217;t get it, but I&#8217;d do the same again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you a married man!&#8221; Audrey burst out, startled,
and diverted, at the explanation, but at the same time outraged
by a confession so cynical.</p>

<p>The detective pulled a silky moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a wife is very strongly convinced that her
sphere is the home,&#8221; he retorted slowly and seriously,
&#8220;you&#8217;re tempted at times to let her have the sphere all
to herself. That&#8217;s the universal experience of married men,
and ye may believe me, miss&mdash;madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now Miss Foley&#8217;s gone north, you&#8217;ve decided to
come and admire <em>me</em> in <em>my</em> home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is your home!&#8221; murmured the detective with
an uncontrolled quickness which wakened Audrey&#8217;s old
suspicions afresh&mdash;and which created a new suspicion, the
suspicion that the fellow was simply playing with her.
&#8220;I assure you I came here to recover; I&#8217;d heard it was
the finest climate in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Recover?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, from fire-extinguishers. D&#8217;ye know I coughed
for twenty-four hours after that reception?... And you
should have seen my clothes! The doctor says my lungs
may never get over it.... That&#8217;s what comes of
admiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what comes of behaving as no married man ought
to behave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I say I was married?&#8221; asked the detective with
an ingenuous air. &#8220;Well, I may be. But I dare say I&#8217;m
only married just about as much as you are yourself,
madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this remark he raised his hat and departed along
the grassy summit of the sea-wall.</p>

<p>Audrey flushed for the second time that morning, and
more strikingly than before. She was extremely discontented
with, and ashamed of, herself, for she had meant
to be the equal of the detective, and she had not been.
It was blazingly clear that he had indeed played with her&mdash;or,
as she put it in her own mind: &#8220;He just stuffed
me up all through.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to think logically. Had he been pursuing
the motor-car all the way from Birmingham? Obviously
he had not, since according to Aguilar he had been in the
vicinity of Moze since the previous morning. Hence he
did not know that Audrey was involved in the Blue City
affair, and he did not know that Jane Foley was at
Frinton. How he had learnt that Audrey belonged to
Moze, and why and what he had come to investigate at
Moze, she could not guess. Nor did these problems appear
to her to have an importance at all equal to the importance
of hiding from the detective that she had been staying
at Frinton. If he followed her to Frinton he would inevitably
discover that Jane Foley was at Frinton, and the
sequel would be more imprisonment for Jane. Therefore
Audrey must not return to Frinton. Having by a masterly
process of ratiocination reached this conclusion, she began
to think rather better of herself, and ceased blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar,&#8221; she demanded excitedly, having gone back
through the plantation. &#8220;Did Miss Ingate happen to say
where I was staying last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must run into the house and write a note to her,
and you must take it down instantly.&#8221; In her mind she
framed the note, which was to condemn Miss Ingate to
the torture of complete and everlasting silence about the
episode at the Blue City and the flight eastwards.</p>



<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_29" id="chapter_29" />CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>FLIGHT</h3>


<p>&#8221;Fast, madam, did you say?&#8221; asked the chauffeur, bending
his head back from the wheel as the car left the gates
of Flank Hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colchester road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really just as quick to take the Frinton road for
Colchester&mdash;it&#8217;s so much straighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no! On no account. Don&#8217;t go near Frinton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey leaned back in the car. And as speed increased
the magnificence of the morning again had its effect on
her. The adventure pleased her far more than the perils
of it, either for herself or for other people, frightened
her. She knew that she was doing a very strange thing
in thus leaving the Spatts and her luggage without a
word of explanation before breakfast; but she did not
care. She knew that for some reason which she did not
comprehend the police were after her, as they had been
after nearly all the great ones of the movement; but she
did not care. She was alive in the rushing car amid the
magnificence of the morning. Musa sat next to her. She
had more or less incompletely explained the situation to
him&mdash;it was not necessary to tell everything to a boy who
depended upon you absolutely for his highest welfare&mdash;such
boys must accept, thankfully, what they received.
And Musa had indeed done so. He appeared to be quite
happy and without anxieties. That was the worst
He had wanted to be with her, and he was with her, and
he cared for nothing else. He had no interest in what
might happen next. He yielded himself utterly to the enjoyment
of her presence and of the magnificent morning.</p>

<p>And yet Musa, whom Audrey considered that she understood
as profoundly as any mother had ever understood
any child&mdash;even Musa could surprise.</p>

<p>He said, without any preparation:</p>

<p>&#8220;I calculate that I shall have 3,040 francs in hand after
the concerts, assuming that I receive only the minimum.
That is, after paying the expenses of my living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you know how much it costs you to live?&#8221;
Audrey demanded, with careless superiority.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly. I write all my payments down in a little
book. I have done so since some years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every sou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Every sou.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you save, Musa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save!&#8221; he repeated the word ingenuously. &#8220;Till
now to save has been impossible for me. But I have
always kept in hand one month&#8217;s subsistence. I could not
do more. Now I shall save. You reproached me with
having spent money in order to come to see you in
England. But I regarded the money so spent as part of
the finance of the concerts. Without seeing you I could
not practise. Without practice I could not play. Without
playing I could not earn money. Therefore I spent money
in order to get money. Such, Madame, was the commercial
side. What a beautiful lawn for tennis you have
in your garden!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was more than surprised, she was staggered
by the revelation of the attitude of genius towards money.
She had not suspected it. Then she remembered the simple
natural tome in which Musa had once told her that both
Tommy and Nick contributed to his income. She ought
to have comprehended from that avowal more than she,
in fact, had comprehended. And now the first hopes of
worldly success were strongly developing that unsuspected
trait in the young man&#8217;s character. Audrey was aware
of a great fear. Could he be a genius, after all? Was
it conceivable that an authentic musical genius should enter
up daily in a little book every sou he spent?</p>

<p>A rapid, spitting, explosive sound, close behind the
car and a little to the right, took her mind away from
Musa and back to the adventure. She looked round, half
expecting what she should see&mdash;and she saw it, namely,
the detective on a motor-cycle. It was an &#8220;Indian&#8221; machine
and painted red. And as she looked, the car, after taking
a corner, got into a straight bit of the splendid road and
the motor-bicycle dropped away from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you shake off that motor-bicycle thing?&#8221; Audrey
rather superciliously asked the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Having first looked at his mirror, the chauffeur, who,
like a horse, could see in two directions at once, gazed
cautiously at the road in front and at the motor-bicycle
behind, simultaneously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it, madam,&#8221; he said. And yet his tone and
glance expressed deep scorn of the motor-bicycle. &#8220;As
a general rule you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought you could beat a little thing
like that,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them things can do sixty when they&#8217;ve a mind to,&#8221;
said the chauffeur, with finality, and gave all his attention
to the road.</p>

<p>At intervals he looked at his mirror. The motor-bicycle
had vanished into the past, and as it failed to reappear he
gradually grew confident and disdainful. But just as the
car was going down the short hill into the outskirts of
Colchester the motor-bicycle came into view once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to, madam?&#8221; inquired the chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Colchester, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she demanded nervously,
though she knew perfectly well that it was Colchester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight through! Straight through!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The London road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The London road,&#8221; she agreed. London was,
of course, the only possible destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;But breakfast, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! The usual thing,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have
yours when I have mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we shall run out of petrol, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Audrey sublimely.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, with characteristic skill, arranged that
the car should run out of petrol precisely in front of the
best hotel in Chelmsford, which was about half-way to
London. The motor-bicycle had not been seen for several
miles. But scarcely had they resumed the journey, by
the Epping road, when it came again into view&mdash;in front
of them. How had the fellow guessed that they would
take the longer Epping road instead of the shorter
Romford road?</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall we be arriving in Frinton?&#8221; Musa inquired,
beatific.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t be arriving in Frinton any more,&#8221; said
Audrey. &#8220;We must go straight to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like a dream,&#8221; Musa murmured, as it were
in ecstasy. Then his features changed and he almost
screamed: &#8220;But my violin! My violin! We must go
back for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Violin!&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;That&#8217;s nothing! I&#8217;ve even
come without gloves.&#8221; And she had.</p>

<p>She reassured Musa as to the violin, and the chauffeur
as to the abandoned Gladstone bag containing the chauffeur&#8217;s
personal effects, and herself as to many things. An
hour and twenty minutes later the car, with three people
in it, thickly dusted even to the eyebrows, drew up in
the courtyard of Charing Cross railway station, and the
motor-cycle was visible, its glaring red somewhat paled,
in the Strand outside. The time was ten-fifteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall take the eleven o&#8217;clock boat train for Paris,&#8221;
she said to Musa.</p>

<p>&#8220;You also?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. He was in heaven. He could even do
without his violin.</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice it is not to be bothered with luggage,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>The chauffeur was pacified with money, of which Audrey
had a sufficiency.</p>

<p>And all the time Audrey kept saying to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to Paris to please Musa, so don&#8217;t let
him think it! I&#8217;m only going so as to put the detective
off and keep Jane Foley out of his clutches, because if I
stay in London he&#8217;ll be bound to find everything out.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Musa kept watch for the detective at the door
of the telegraph office Audrey telegraphed, as laconically
as possible, to Frinton concerning clothes and the violin,
and then they descended to subterranean marble chambers
in order to get rid of dust, and they came up to earth
again, each out of a separate cellar, renewed. And, lastly,
Audrey slipped into the Strand and bought a pair of gloves,
and thereafter felt herself to be completely equipped against
the world&#8217;s gaze.</p>

<h3>ARIADNE</h3>


<p>A few days later an automobile&mdash;not Audrey&#8217;s but a large
limousine&mdash;bumped, with slow and soft dignity, across the
railway lines which diversify the quays of Boulogne harbour
and, having hooted in a peculiar manner, came to a stop
opposite nothing in particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, reaching to open
the door. &#8220;You can see her masthead light.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was getting dark. Behind, over the station, a very
faint flush lightened the west, and in front, across the
water, and reflected in the water, the thousand lamps of
the town rose in tiers to the lofty church which stood out
a dark mass against the summer sky. On the quays the
forms of men moved vaguely among crates and packages,
and on the water, tugs and boats flitted about, puffing,
or with the plash of oars, or with no sound whatever.
And from the distance arrived the reverberation of electric
trams running their courses in the maze of the town.</p>

<p>Madame Piriac and Audrey descended, after Mr. Gilman,
from the car and Mr. Gilman turned off the electric light
in the interior and shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not trouble about the luggage, I beg you,&#8221; said
Mr. Gilman, breathing, as usual, rather noticeably. &#8220;<em>Bon
soir</em>, Leroux. Don&#8217;t forget to meet the nine-thirty-five.&#8221;
This last to the white-clad chauffeur, who saluted sharply.</p>

<p>At the same moment two sailors appeared over the edge
of the quay, and a Maltese cross of light burst into radiance
at the end of a sloping gangway, whose summit was
just perched on the solid masonry of the port. The sailors
were clothed in blue, with white caps, and on their breasts
they bore the white-embroidered sign: &#8220;<em>Ariadne, R.T.Y.C.</em>&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look lively, lads, with the luggage,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then another figure appeared under the Maltese cross.
It was clad in white ducks, with a blue reefer ornamented
in gold, and a yachting cap crowned in white: a stoutish
and middle-aged figure, much like Mr. Gilman himself in
bearing and costume, except that Mr. Gilman had no gold
on his jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, skipper!&#8221; greeted Mr. Gilman, jauntily and
spryly. In one moment, in one second, Mr. Gilman had
grown at least twenty years younger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Wyatt,&#8221; he presented the skipper to the
ladies. &#8220;And this is Mr. Price, my secretary, and Doctor
Cromarty,&#8221; as two youths, clothed exactly to match Mr.
Gilman, followed the skipper up the steep incline of the
gangway.</p>

<p>And now Audrey could see the <em>Ariadne</em> lying below, for
it was only just past low water and the tide was scarcely
making. At the next berth higher up, with lights gleaming
at her innumerable portholes and two cranes hard at work
producing a mighty racket on her, lay a Channel steamer,
which, by comparison with the yacht, loomed enormous, like
an Atlantic liner. Indeed, the yacht seemed a very little and
a very lowly and a very flimsy flotation on the dark water,
and her illuminated deck-house was no better than a toy.
On the other hand, her two masts rose out of the deep high
overhead and had a certain impressiveness, though not
quite enough.</p>

<p>Audrey thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this what we&#8217;re going on? I thought it was a big
yacht.&#8221; And she had a qualm.</p>

<p>And then a bell rang twice, extremely sweet and mellow,
somewhere on the yacht. And Audrey was touched by the
beauty of its tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two bells. Nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman. &#8220;Will
you come aboard? I&#8217;ll show you the way.&#8221; He tripped
down the gangway like a boy. Behind could be heard the
sailors giving one another directions about the true method
of handling luggage.</p>

<p>Audrey had met Madame Piriac by sheer hazard in a
corset shop in the Rue de la Chaussée-d&#8217;Antin. The fugitive
from justice had been obliged, in the matter of wardrobe,
to begin life again on her arrival trunkless in Paris, and
the business of doing so was not disagreeable. Madame
Piriac had greeted her with most affectionate warmth. One
of her first suggestions had been that Audrey should accompany
her on a short yachting trip projected by Mr. Gilman.
She had said that though the excellent Gilman was her
uncle, and her adored uncle, he was not her real uncle, and
that therefore, of course, she was incapable of going unaccompanied,
though she would hate to disappoint the dear
man. As for Monsieur Piriac, the destiny of France was in
his hands, and the moment being somewhat critical, he
would not quit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs without
leaving a fixed telegraphic address.</p>

<p>On the next day Mr. Gilman and Madame Piriac had
called on Audrey at the Hôtel du Danube, and the invitation
became formal. It was pressing and flattering. Why
refuse it? Mr. Gilman was obviously prepared to be her
slave. She accepted, with enthusiasm. And she said to
herself that in doing so she was putting yet another spoke
in the wheel of the British police. Immediately afterwards
she learnt that Musa also had been asked. Madame Piriac
informed her, in reply to a sort of protest, that Musa&#8217;s first
concert was postponed by the concert agency until the
autumn. &#8220;I never heard of that!&#8221; Audrey had cried.
&#8220;And why should you have heard of it? Have you not
been in England?&#8221; Madame Piriac had answered, a little
surprised at Audrey&#8217;s tone. Whereupon Audrey had said
naught. The chief point was that Musa could take a holiday
without detriment to his career. Moreover, Mr. Gilman,
who possessed everything, possessed a marvellous violin,
which he would put at the disposal of Musa on the yacht if
Musa&#8217;s own violin had not been found in the meantime.
The official story was that Musa&#8217;s violin had been mislaid or
lost on the Métropolitain Railway, and the fact that he had
been to England somehow did not transpire at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman had gone forward in advance to make sure
that his yacht was in a state worthy to receive two such
ladies, and he had insisted on meeting them in his car
at Abbeville on the way to Boulogne. He had not insisted
on meeting Musa similarly. He was a peculiar and in
some respects a stiff-necked man. He had decided, in his
own mind, that he would have the two women to himself
in the car, and so indeed it fell out. Nevertheless his attitude
to Musa, and Madame Piriac&#8217;s attitude to Musa, and
everybody&#8217;s attitude to Musa, had shown that the mere
prospect of star-concerts in a first-class hall had very
quickly transformed Musa into a genuine Parisian lion. He
was positively courted. His presence on the yacht was
deemed an honour, and that was why Mr. Gilman had asked
him. Audrey both resented the remarkable change and was
proud of it&mdash;as a mother perhaps naturally would do and
be. The admitted genius was to arrive the next morning.</p>

<p>On boarding the <em>Ariadne</em> in the wake of Mr. Gilman and
Madame Piriac, the first thing that impressed Audrey was
the long gangway itself. It was made of thin resilient steel,
and the handrails were of soft white rope, almost like silk,
and finished off with fancy knots; and at the beginning of
the gangway, on the dirty quay, lay a beautiful mat bearing
the name of the goddess, while at the end, on the pale,
smooth deck, was another similar mat. The obvious costliness
of that gangway and those superlative mats made
Audrey feel poor, in spite of her ten million francs. And
the next thing that impressed her was that immediately she
got down on deck the yacht, in a very mysterious manner,
had grown larger, and much larger. At the forward extremity
of the deck certain blue figures lounging about
seemed to be quite a long way off, indeed in another world.
Here and there on the deck were circles of yellow or white
rope, coiled as precisely and perfectly as Audrey could coil
her own hair. Mr. Gilman led them to the door of the deck-house
and they gazed within. The sight of the interior
drew out of the ravished Audrey an ecstatic exclamation:
&#8220;What a darling!&#8221; And at the words she saw that Mr.
Gilman, for all his assumed nonchalant spryness, almost
trembled with pleasure. The deck-house was a drawing-room
whose walls were of carved and inlaid wood. Orange-shaded
electric bulbs hung on short, silk cords from the
ceiling, and flowers in sconces showed brilliantly between
the windows, which were draped with curtains of silk matching
the thick carpet. Several lounge chairs and a table of
bird&#8217;s-eye maple completed the place, and over the table
were scattered newspapers and illustrated weeklies. Everything,
except the literature, was somewhat diminished in
size, but the smallness of the scale only intensified the
pleasure derived from the spectacle.</p>

<p>Then they went &#8220;downstairs,&#8221; as Audrey said; but Mr.
Gilman corrected her and said &#8220;below,&#8221; whereupon Audrey
retorted that she should call it the &#8220;ground floor,&#8221; and Mr.
Gilman laughed as she had never heard a man of his age
laugh. The sight of the ground floor still further increased
Audrey&#8217;s notion of the dimensions of the yacht, whose corridors
and compartments appeared to stretch away endlessly
in two directions. At the foot of the curving staircase Mr.
Gilman, pulling aside a curtain, announced: &#8220;This is the
saloon.&#8221; When she heard the word Audrey expected a
poky cubicle, but found a vast drawing-room with more
books than she had ever seen in any other drawing-room,
many pictures, an open piano, with music on it; sofas in
every quarter, and about a thousand cupboards and drawers,
each with a silver knob or handle. Above all was a dome of
multi-coloured glass, and exactly beneath the dome a table
set for supper, with the finest napery, cutlery and crystal.
The apartment was dazzlingly lighted, and yet not a single
lamp could be detected in the act of illumination. A real
parlourmaid suddenly appeared at the far end of the room,
and behind her two stewards in gilt-buttoned white Eton
jackets and black trousers. Mr. Gilman, with seriousness,
bade the parlourmaid take charge of the ladies and show
them the sleeping-cabins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose any cabins you like,&#8221; said he, as Madame
Piriac and Audrey rustled off.</p>

<p>There might have been hundreds of sleeping-cabins. And
there did, in fact, appear to be quite a number of them,
to say nothing of two bathrooms. They inspected all of
them save one, which was locked. In an awed voice the
parlourmaid said, &#8220;That is the owner&#8217;s cabin.&#8221; At another
door she said, in a different, disdainful voice, &#8220;That only
leads to the galley and the crew&#8217;s quarters.&#8221; Audrey
wondered what a galley could be, and the mystery of that
name, and the mystery of the two closed doors, merely made
the whole yacht perfect. The sleeping-cabins surpassed all
else&mdash;they were so compact, so complex, so utterly complete.
No large bedchamber, within Audrey&#8217;s knowledge, held so
much apparatus, and offered so much comfort and so much
wardrobe room as even the least of these cabins. It was
impossible, to be sure, that in one&#8217;s amused researches one
had not missed a cupboard ingeniously disguised somewhere.
And the multiplicity of mirrors, and the message of the
laconic monosyllable &#8220;Hot&#8221; on silver taps, and the discretion
of the lighting, all indicated that the architect and
creator of these marvellous microcosms had &#8220;understood.&#8221;
The cosy virtue of littleness, and the entire absurdity of
space for the sake of space, were strikingly proved, and
the demonstration amounted, in Audrey&#8217;s mind, to a new and
delicious discovery.</p>

<p>The largest of the cabins had two berths at right angles
to one another, each a lovely little bed with a running screen
of cashmere. Having admired it once, they returned to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, my dear,&#8221; said Madame Piriac in
French, &#8220;I have an idea. You will tell me if it is not
good.... If we shared this cabin ...! In this so curious
machine one feels a satisfaction, somehow, in being very
near the one to the other. The ceiling is so low.... That
gives you sensations&mdash;human sensations.... I know not
if you experience the same....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Let&#8217;s!&#8221; Audrey exclaimed impulsively in
English. &#8220;Do let&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the parlourmaid had gone, and before the luggage
had come down, Madame Piriac caught Audrey to her and
kissed her fervently on both cheeks, amid the glinting confusion
of polished woods and draperies and silver mountings
and bevelled glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so content that you came, my little one!&#8221;
murmured Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>The next minute the cabin and the corridor outside were
full of open trunks and bags, over which bent the forms of
Madame Piriac, Audrey and the parlourmaid. And all the
drawers were gaping, and the doors of all the cupboards
swinging, and the narrow beds were hidden under piles of
variegated garments. And while they were engaged in the
breathless business of installing themselves in the celestial
domain, strange new thoughts flitted about like mice in
Audrey&#8217;s head. She felt as though she were in a refuge
from the world, and as though her conscience was being
narcotised. In that cabin, firm as solid land and yet floating
on the water, with Mr. Gilman at hand her absolute slave&mdash;in
that cabin the propaganda of women&#8217;s suffrage presented
itself as a very odd and very remote phenomenon, a phenomenon
scarcely real. She had positively everything she
wanted without fighting for it. The lion&#8217;s share of life was
hers. Comfort and luxury were desirable and beautiful
things, not to be cast aside nor scorned. Madame Piriac
was a wise woman and a good woman. She was a happy
woman.... There was a great deal of ugliness in sitting
on Joy Wheels and being chased by policemen. True, as she
had heard, a crew of nineteen human beings was necessary
to the existence of Mr. Gilman and his guests on board the
yacht. Well, what then? The nineteen were undoubtedly
well treated and in clover. And the world was the world;
you had to take it as you found it.... And then in her
mind she had a glimpse of the blissful face of Jane Foley&mdash;blissful
in a different way from any other face she had met
in all her life. Disconcerting, this glimpse, for an instant,
but only for an instant! She, Audrey, was blissful, too.
The intense desire for joy and pleasure surged up in her....
The bell which she had previously heard struck three;
its delicate note vibrated long through the yacht, unwilling
to expire. Half-past nine, and supper and the chivalry of
Mr. Gilman waiting for them in the elegance of the saloon!</p>

<p>As the two women approached the <em>portière</em> which
screened the forward entrance to the saloon, they heard
Mr. Gilman say, in a weary and resigned voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose there&#8217;s nothing better than a whisky
and soda.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the vivacious reply of a steward:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The owner was lounging in a corner, with a gloomy,
bored look on his face. But as soon as the <em>portière</em> stirred
and he saw the smiles of Madame Piriac and Audrey upon
him, his whole demeanour changed in an instant. He
sprang up, laughed, furtively smoothed his waistcoat, and
managed to convey the general idea that he had a keen
interest in life, and that the keenest part of that interest
was due to a profound instinctive desire to serve these two
beautiful benefactors of mankind&mdash;the idea apparently being
that the charming creatures had conferred a favour on the
human race by consenting to exist. He cooed round them,
he offered them cushions, he inquired after their physical
condition, he expressed his fear lest the cabins had not
contained every convenience that caprice might expect. He
was excited; surely he was happy! Audrey persuaded herself
that this must, after all, be his true normal condition
while aboard the yacht, and that the ennui visible on his
features a moment earlier could only have been transient and
accidental.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure the piano is as wonderful as all else on
board,&#8221; said Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do play!&#8221; he entreated. &#8220;I love to hear music here.
My secretary plays for me when I am alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, who do not adore music!&#8221; Madame Piriac protested
against the invitation. But she sat down on the clamped
music stool and began a waltz.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, dropping into a seat by Audrey.
&#8220;I wish I danced!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t mean to say you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Audrey,
with fascination. She felt that she could fascinate him, and
that it was her duty to fascinate him.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman responded to the challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I do,&#8221; he said modestly. &#8220;We must have a
dance on deck one night. I&#8217;ll tell my secretary to get the
gramophone into order. I have a pretty good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely!&#8221; Audrey agreed. &#8220;I do think the
<em>Ariadne&#8217;s</em> the most heavenly thing, Mr. Gilman! I&#8217;d no
idea what a yacht was! I hope you&#8217;ll tell me the proper
names for all the various parts&mdash;you know what I mean.
I hate to use the wrong words. It&#8217;s not polite on a yacht,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>His smile was entranced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I will go round by ourselves to-morrow morning,
Mrs. Moncreiff,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Just then the steward appeared with the whisky and
soda, but Mr. Gilman dismissed him with a sharp gesture,
and he vanished back into the unexplored parts of the
vessel. The implication was that the society of Audrey
made whisky and soda a superfluity for Mr. Gilman.
Although she was so young, he treated her with exactly
the same deference as he lavished on Madame Piriac,
indeed with perhaps a little more. If Madame Piriac was
for him the incarnation of sweetness and balm and majesty,
so also was Audrey, and Audrey had the advantage of
novelty. She was growing, morally, every minute. The
confession of Musa had filled her with a good notion of
herself. The impulsive flattery of Madame Piriac in the
joint cabin, and now the sincere, grave homage of Mr. Gilman,
caused her to brim over with consciousness that she
was at last somebody.</p>

<p>An automobile hooted on the quay, and at the disturbing
sound Madame Piriac ceased to play and swung round on
the stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;that must be our other lady guest,&#8221; said Mr.
Gilman, who had developed nervousness; his cheeks flushed
darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah?&#8221; cautiously smiled Madame Piriac, who was
plainly taken aback.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman. &#8220;Miss Thompkins. Before I
knew for certain that Mrs. Moncreiff could come with you,
Hortense, I asked Miss Thompkins if she would care to
come. I only got her answer this morning&mdash;it was delayed.
I meant to tell you.... You are a friend of Miss Thompkins,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; He turned to Audrey.</p>

<p>Audrey replied gaily that she knew Tommy very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better go up,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, and he departed,
and his back, though a nervous back, seemed to be defying
Madame Piriac and Audrey to question in the slightest
degree his absolute right to choose his own guests on his
own yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange man!&#8221; muttered Madame Piriac. It was a
confidence to Audrey, who eagerly accepted it as such.
&#8220;Imagine him inviting Mees Thompkins without a word to
us, without a word! But, you know, my dear uncle was
always bizarre, mysterious. Yet&mdash;is he mysterious, or is
he ingenuous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did he come to know Miss Thompkins?&#8221;
Audrey demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! You have not heard that? Miss Thompkins gave
a&mdash;a musical tea in her studio, to celebrate these concerts
which are to occur. Musa asked the Foas to come. They
consented. It was understood they should bring friends.
Thus I went also, and Monsieur Gilman being at my orders
that afternoon, he went too. Never have I seen so strange
a multitude! But it was amusing. And all Paris has begun
to talk of Musa. Miss Thompkins and my uncle became
friends on the instant. I assume that it was her eyes. Also
those Americans have vivacity, if not always distinction.
Do you not think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! And do you mean to say that on the strength
of that he asked her to go yachting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he had called several times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you surprised she accepted?&#8221; asked Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Madame Piriac. &#8220;It is another code, that
is all. It is a surprise, but she will be amusing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure she will,&#8221; Audrey concurred. &#8220;I&#8217;m frightfully
fond of her myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They glanced at each other very intimately, like long-established
allies who fear an aggression&mdash;and are ready
for it.</p>

<p>Then steps were heard. Miss Thompkins entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Miss Thompkins, gazing first at
Audrey and then at Madame Piriac. &#8220;Of all the loveliest
shocks&mdash;&mdash;Say, Musa&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind her stood Musa. It appeared that he had been
able to get away by the same train as Tommy.</p>

<h3>THE NOSTRUM</h3>


<p>The hemisphere of heaven was drenched in moonlight, and&mdash;rare
happening either on British earth or on the waters
surrounding it, in mid-summer&mdash;the night was warm. In
the midst of the glittering sea the yacht moved without the
appearance of motion; only by leaning over the rail and
watching the bubbles glide away from her could you detect
her progress. There were no waves, no ripples, nothing
but a scarcely perceptible swell. The gentle breeze, unnoticeable
on deck, was abaft; all the sails had been
lowered and stowed except the large square sail bent on a
yard to the mainmast and never used except with such a
wind. The <em>Ariadne</em> had a strong flood tide under her, and
her 200-h.p. twin motors were stopped. Hence there
was no tremor in the ship and no odour of paraffin in the
nostrils of those who chanced to wander aft of the engine-room.
The deck awning had been rolled up to the centre,
and at the four corners of its frame had been hung four
temporary electric lights within Chinese lanterns. A
radiance ascended from the saloon skylight; the windows
of the deck-house blazed as usual, but the deck-house was
empty; a very subdued glow indicated where the binnacle
was. And, answering these signs of existence, could be
distinguished the red and green lights of steamers, the firm
rays of lighthouses, and the red or white warnings of gas-buoys
run by clockwork.</p>

<p>The figures of men and women&mdash;the women in pale
gowns, the men in blue-and-white&mdash;lounged or strolled on
the spotless deck which unseen hands swabbed and stoned
every morning at 6 o&#8217;clock; and among these figures passed
the figure of a steward with a salver, staying them with
flagons, comforting them with the finest exotic fruit.
Occasionally the huge square sail gave an idle flap. &#8220;Get
that lead out, &#8217;Orace,&#8221; commanded a grim voice from the
wheel. A splash followed, as a man straddled himself over
the starboard bow, swung a weighted line to and fro and
threw it from him. &#8220;Four.&#8221; Another splash. &#8220;Four.&#8221;
Another splash. &#8220;Four.&#8221; Another splash. &#8220;Three-half.&#8221;
Another splash. &#8220;Three-half.&#8221; Another splash. &#8220;Three.&#8221;
Another splash. &#8220;Two-half.&#8221; Another splash. &#8220;Three.&#8221;
Another splash. &#8220;Five.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;ll do, &#8217;Orace,&#8221; came the
voice from the wheel. Then an entranced silence.</p>

<p>The scene had the air of being ideal. And yet it was
not. Something lacked. That something was the owner.
The owner lay indisposed in the sacred owner&#8217;s cabin. And
this was a pity because a dance had been planned for that
night. It might have taken place without the owner, but
the strains of the gramophone and especially the shuffling
of feet on the deck would have disturbed him. True, he
had sent up word by Doctor Cromarty that he was not to
be considered. But the doctor had delivered the message
without any conviction, and the unanimous decision was
that the owner must, at all costs, be considered.</p>

<p>It was Ostend, on top of the owner&#8217;s original offer to
Audrey, that had brought about the suggestion of a dance.
They had coasted up round Gris-Nez from Boulogne to
Ostend, and had reached the harbour there barely in time
to escape from the worst of a tempest that had already
begun to produce in the minds of sundry passengers a grave
doubt whether yachting was, after all, the most delightful
of pursuits. Some miles before the white dome of the
Kursaal was sighted the process of moral decadence had set
in, and passengers were lying freely to each other, and
boastfully lying, just as though somebody had been accusing
them of some dreadful crime of cowardice or bad breeding
instead of merely inquiring about the existence of physical
symptoms over which they admittedly had no control whatever.
The security of a harbour, with a railway station not
fifty yards from the yacht&#8217;s bowsprit, had restored them,
by dint of calming secret fears, to their customary condition
of righteousness and rectitude. Several days of
gusty rainstorms had elapsed at Ostend, and the passengers
had had the opportunity to study the method of managing
a yacht, and to visit the neighbourhood. The one was as
wondrous as the other. They found letters and British and
French newspapers on their plates at breakfast. And the
first object they had seen on the quay, and the last object
they saw there, was the identical large limousine which they
had left on the quay at Boulogne. It would have taken
them to Ghent but for the owner&#8217;s powerful objection to
their eating any meal off the yacht. Seemingly he had a
great and sincere horror of local viands and particularly of
local water. He was their slave; they might demand anything
from him; he was the very symbol of hospitality and
chivalry, but somehow they could not compass a meal
away from the yacht. Similarly, he would have them leave
the Kursaal not later than ten o&#8217;clock, when the evening had
not veritably begun. They did not clearly understand by
what means he imposed his will, but he imposed it.</p>

<p>The departure from Ostend was accomplished after the
glass had begun to rise, but before it had finished rising, and
there were apprehensions in the saloon and out of it, when
the spectacle of the open sea, and the feel of it under the
feet, showed that, as of old, water was still unstable. The
process of moral decadence would have set in once more
but for the prudence and presence of mind of Audrey, who
had laid in a large stock of the specific which had been of
such notable use to herself and Miss Ingate on previous
occasions. Praising openly its virtues, confessing frankly
her own weakness and preaching persuasively her own
faith, she had distributed the nostrum, and in about a
quarter of an hour had established a justifiable confidence.
Mr. Gilman alone would not partake, and indeed she had
hardly dared to offer the thing to so experienced a sailor.
The day had favoured her. The sea grew steadily more
tranquil, and after skirting the Belgian and French coasts
for some little distance the <em>Ariadne</em>, under orders, had
turned her nose boldly northward for the estuary of the
Thames. The <em>Ariadne</em> was now in the midst of that very
complicated puzzle of deeps and shallows. The passengers,
in fact, knew that they were in the region of the North
Edinburgh, but what or where the North Edinburgh was
they had only the vaguest idea. The blot on the voyage
had been the indisposition of Mr. Gilman, who had taken
to his berth early, and who saw nobody but his doctor,
through whom he benignantly administered the world of the
yacht. Doctor Cromarty had a face which imparted nothing
and yet implied everything. He said less and meant more
than even the average pure-blooded Scotsman. It was
imparted that Mr. Gilman had a chronic complaint. The
implications were vast and baffling.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall dance after all,&#8221; said Miss Thompkins, bending
with a mysterious gesture over Audrey, who reclined in
a deck-chair near the companion leading to the deserted
engine-room. Miss Thompkins was dressed in lacy white,
with a string of many tinted beads round her slim neck.
Her tawny hair was arranged in a large fluffiness, and the
ensemble showed to a surprised Audrey what Miss
Thompkins could accomplish when she deemed the occasion
to be worthy of an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we? What makes you think so, dear?&#8221; absently
asked Audrey, in whom the scene had induced profound
reflections upon life and the universe.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come up on deck,&#8221; said Miss Thompkins, disclosing
her teeth in an inscrutable smile that the moonbeams
made more strange than it actually was. &#8220;Like to know
how I know? Sure you&#8217;d like to know, Mrs. Simplicity?&#8221;
Her beads rattled above Audrey&#8217;s insignificant upturned
nose. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t a yacht the queerest little self-contained state
you ever visited? It&#8217;s as full of party politics as
Massachusetts; and that&#8217;s some. Well, I didn&#8217;t use all my
medicine you gave me. Didn&#8217;t need it. So I&#8217;ve shared it
with <em>him</em>. I got the empty packet with all the instructions
on it, and I put two of my tablets in it, and if he hasn&#8217;t
swallowed them by this time my name isn&#8217;t Anne Tuckett
Thompkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s been&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey, you&#8217;re making a noise like a goose. &#8217;Course
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you manage to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave them to Mr. Price, with instructions to leave
them by the&mdash;er&mdash;bedside. Mr. Price is a friend. I hope
I&#8217;ve made that plain these days to everybody, including Mr.
Gilman. Mr. Price is a good sample of what painters are
liable to come to after they&#8217;ve found out they don&#8217;t care
for the smell of oil-tubes. I knew him when he always
said &#8216;Puvis&#8217; instead of &#8216;Puvis de Chavannes.&#8217; He&#8217;s cured
now. If I hadn&#8217;t happened to know he&#8217;d be on board I
shouldn&#8217;t have dared to come. He&#8217;s my lifebuoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I assure you, Tommy, Mr. Gilman refused the
stuff from me. He did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Dove! Wood-pigeon! Of course he refused it.
He was bound to. Owner of a two-hundred-and-fifty-ton
yacht taking a remedy for sea-sickness in public on the
two-hundred-and-fifty-ton yacht! The very idea makes you
shiver. But he&#8217;ll take it down there. And he won&#8217;t ask
any questions. And he&#8217;ll hide it from the doctor. And
he&#8217;ll pretend, and he&#8217;ll expect everybody else to pretend,
that he&#8217;s never been within a mile of the stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy, I don&#8217;t believe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s a lovely man, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy, I don&#8217;t believe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you do. You&#8217;d like not to, but you can&#8217;t help it.
I sometimes do bruise people badly in their organ of
illusions-about-human-nature, but it is fun, after all,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting down to the facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accompanied by the tattoo of her necklace, Miss
Thompkins moved away in the direction of Madame Piriac,
who was engaged with Musa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit I&#8217;m rather brilliant to-night,&#8221; she threw over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>The dice seem to be always loaded in favour of the
Misses Thompkins of society. Less than a quarter of an
hour later Doctor Cromarty, showing his head just above
the level of the deck, called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Price, ye can wind up that box o&#8217; yours. Mr. Gilman
is coming on deck. He&#8217;s wonderful better.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_32" id="chapter_32" />CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>BY THE BINNACLE</h3>


<p>The owner was at the wheel. But he had not got there
at once. This singular man, who strangely enough was
wearing one of his most effulgent and heterogeneous club
neckties, had begun by dancing. He danced with all three
ladies, one after the other; and he did not merely dance&mdash;he
danced modernly, he danced the new dances to the new
tunes, given off like intoxicating gas from the latest of
gramophones. He knew how to hold the arm of a woman
above her head, while coiling his own around it in the
manner of a snake, and he knew how to make his very
body a vast syncopation. The effect of his arrival was as
singular as himself. Captain Wyatt, Doctor Cromarty and
Mr. Price withdrew to that portion of the deck about the
wheel which convention had always roped off for them with
invisible ropes. The captain, by custom, messed by himself,
whereas the other two had their meals in the saloon,
entering and leaving quickly and saying little while at table.
But apart from meals the three formed a separate clan on
the yacht. The indisposition of the owner had dissolved
this clan into the general population of the saloon. The
recovery of the owner re-created it. Mr. Price had suddenly
begun to live arduously for the gramophone alone.
And when summoned by the owner to come and form half
of the third couple for dancing, Doctor Cromarty had the
air of arousing himself from a meditation upon medicine.
Also, the passengers themselves danced with conscientiousness,
with elaborate gusto and with an earnest desire to
reach a high standard. And between dances everybody
went up to Mr. Gilman and said how lovely it all was. And
it really was lovely.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman had taken the wheel after about the sixth
dance. Approaching Audrey, who owed him the next dance,
he had said that the skipper had hinted something about his
taking the wheel and he thought he had better oblige the
old fellow, if Audrey was quite, quite sure she didn&#8217;t mind,
and would she come and sit by him instead&mdash;for one dance?
... As soon as two sailors had fixed cushions for Audrey,
and the skipper had given the owner the course, all persons
seemed to withdraw respectfully from the pair, who were
in the shadow of a great spar, with the glimmer of the
binnacle just in front of them. The square sail had been
lowered, and the engines started, and a steady, faint throb
kept the yacht mysteriously alive in every plank of her.
The gramophone and the shuffle of feet continued, because
Mr. Gilman had expressly desired that his momentary
defection with a lady and in obedience to duty should not
bring the ball to an end. Laughter and even giggles came
from the ballroom. Males were dancing together. The
power of the moon had increased. The binnacle-light, however,
threw up a radiance of its own on to Mr. Gilman&#8217;s
lowered face, the face of a kind, a good, and a dependably
expert individuality who was watching over the
safety, the welfare and the highest interests of every soul
on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very sorry to be laid up to-day,&#8221; Mr. Gilman
began suddenly, in a very quiet voice, frowning benevolently
at the black pointer on the compass. &#8220;But, of
course, you know my great enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Audrey gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Doc told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Cromarty? No, he doesn&#8217;t tell much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, looking round quickly and
shyly, rather in the manner of a boy, &#8220;it&#8217;s liver.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey seemed to read in his face, first, that Doctor
Cromarty had received secret orders never to tell anybody
anything, and, second, that the great enemy was not liver.
And she thought: &#8220;So this is human nature! Mature
men, wise men, dignified men, do descend to these paltry
deceits just in order to keep up appearances, though they
must know quite well that they don&#8217;t deceive anyone who
is worth deceiving.&#8221; The remarkable fact was that she
did not feel in the least shocked or disdainful. She merely
decided&mdash;and found a certain queer pleasure in the decision&mdash;that
human nature was a curious phenomenon, and that
there must be a lot of it on earth. And she felt kindly
towards Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d said gout&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I always
understood that men generally had gout.&#8221; And she consciously,
with intention, employed a simple, innocent tone,
knowing that it misled Mr. Gilman, and wanting it to
mislead him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Liver. All sailors suffer from
it, more or less. It&#8217;s the bugbear of the sea. I have a
doctor on board because, with a score or so of crew, it&#8217;s
really a duty to have a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite see that,&#8221; Audrey agreed, thinking mildly:
&#8220;You only have a doctor on board because you&#8217;re always
worrying about your own health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, &#8220;he&#8217;s not much use to
me personally. He doesn&#8217;t understand liver. Scotsmen
never do. Fortunately, I have a very good doctor in Paris.
I prefer French doctors. And I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re right on the
great liver question. All English doctors tell you to take
plenty of violent exercise if you want to shake off a liver
attack. Quite wrong. Too much exercise tires the body
and so it tires the liver as well&mdash;obviously. What&#8217;s the
result? You can see, can&#8217;t you? The liver works worse
than ever. Now, a French doctor will advise complete rest
until the attack is over. <em>Then</em> exercise, if you like; but not
before. Of course, <em>you</em> don&#8217;t know you&#8217;ve got a liver, and
I dare say you think it&#8217;s very odd of me to talk about my
liver. I&#8217;m sure you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, honestly. I like you to talk like that. It&#8217;s
very interesting.&#8221; And she thought: &#8220;Suppose Tommy
was wrong, after all! ... She&#8217;s very spiteful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s you all over, Mrs. Moncreiff. You understand
men far better than any other woman I ever saw, unless,
perhaps, it&#8217;s Madame Piriac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Gilman! How can you say such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the first time you&#8217;ve heard it, I wager!&#8221; said
Mr. Gilman. &#8220;And it won&#8217;t be the last! Any man who
knows women can see at once that you are one of the
women who understand. Otherwise, do you imagine I
should have begun upon my troubles?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, at any rate, he was sincere&mdash;she was convinced
of that. And he looked very smart as he spied the horizon
for lights and peered at the compass, and moved the wheel
at intervals with a strong, accustomed gesture. And,
assuredly, he looked very experienced. Audrey blushed.
She just had to believe that there must be something in
what he said concerning her talent. She had noticed it herself
several times.</p>

<p>In an interval of the music the sea washed with a long
sound against the bow of the yacht; then silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love that sudden wash against the yacht,&#8221; said
Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Mr. Gilman, &#8220;so do I. All doctors tell
me that I should be better if I gave up yachting. But I
won&#8217;t. I couldn&#8217;t. Whatever it costs in health, yachting&#8217;s
worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! It must be!&#8221; cried Audrey, with enthusiasm.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been on a yacht before, but I quite agree with
you. I feel as if I could live on a yacht for ever&mdash;always
going to new places, you know; that&#8217;s how I feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; Mr. Gilman exclaimed and gazed at her for
a moment with a sort of ecstasy. Audrey instinctively
checked herself. &#8220;There&#8217;s a freemasonry among those
who like yachting.&#8221; His eyes returned to the compass.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept your secret. I&#8217;ve kept it like something precious.
I&#8217;ve enjoyed keeping it. It&#8217;s been a comfort to me. Now
I wonder if you&#8217;ll do the same for me, Mrs. Moncreiff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; Audrey asked weakly, intimidated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a secret. I shouldn&#8217;t dream of telling it to
Madame Piriac. Will you? May I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you think you can trust me,&#8221; said Audrey, concealing,
with amazing ease and skill, her excitement and
her mighty pleasure in the scene.... &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t dream
of telling it to Madame Piriac.&#8221; ... It is doubtful whether
she had ever enjoyed anything so much, and yet she was
as prim as a nun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a happy man, Mrs. Moncreiff. Materially, I&#8217;ve
everything a man can want, I suppose. But I&#8217;m not happy.
You may laugh and say it&#8217;s my liver. But it isn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re
a woman of the world; you know what life is; and yet
experience hasn&#8217;t spoilt you. I could say anything
to you; anything! And you wouldn&#8217;t be shocked, would
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Audrey, hoping, nevertheless, that he would
not say &#8220;anything, anything,&#8221; but somehow simultaneously
hoping that he would. It was a disconcerting sensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you always to remember that I&#8217;m unhappy and
never to tell anybody,&#8221; Mr. Gilman resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a kindness to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, why are you unhappy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My opinions have all changed. I used to think I could
be independent of women. Not that I didn&#8217;t like women!
I did. But when I&#8217;d left them I was quite happy. You
know what the facts of life are, Mrs. Moncreiff. Young as
you are you are older than me in some respects, though I
have a long life before me. It&#8217;s just because I have a long
life before me&mdash;dyspeptics are always long-lived&mdash;that I&#8217;m
afraid for the future. It wouldn&#8217;t matter so much if I was
an old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; asked Audrey adventurously, &#8220;why should you
be unhappy because your opinions have changed? What
opinions?&#8221; She endeavoured to be perfectly judicial and
indifferent, and yet kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;What opinions? Well, about Woman Suffrage, for
instance. You remember that night at the Foas&#8217;, and
what I remarked afterwards about what you all said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;But can <em>you</em>
remember it? Fancy you remembering a thing like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember every word that was said. It changed me....
Not at first. Oh, no! Not for several days, perhaps
weeks. I fought against it. Then I said to myself, &#8216;How
absurd to fight against it!&#8217; ... Well, I&#8217;ve come to believe
in women having the vote. You&#8217;ve no more stanch supporter
than I am. I <em>want</em> women to have the vote. And
you&#8217;re the first person I&#8217;ve ever said that to. I want <em>you</em>
to have the vote.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled at her, and she saw scores and scores of
excellent qualities in his smile; she could not believe that
he had any defect whatever. His secret was precious to
her. She considered that he had confided it to her in a
manner both distinguished and poetical. He had shown a
quality which no youth could have shown. Youths were
inferior, crude, incomplete. Not that Mr. Gilman was not
young! Emphatically he was young, but her conception
of the number of years comprised in youthfulness had been
enlarged. She saw, as in a magical enlightenment, that
forty was young, fifty was young, any age was young provided
it had the right gestures. As for herself, she was
without age. The obvious fact that Mr. Gilman was her
slave touched her; it saddened her, but sweetly; it gave her
a new sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I still don&#8217;t see why this change of view should make
you unhappy. I should have thought it would have just the
opposite effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has altered all my desires,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Do you
know, I&#8217;m not really interested in this new yacht now! And
that&#8217;s the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gilman!&#8221; she checked him. &#8220;How can you say
such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>It now appeared that she was not a nice girl. If she
had been a nice girl she would not have comprehended
what Mr. Gilman was ultimately driving at. The word
&#8220;marriage&#8221; would never have sounded in her brain. And
she would have been startled and shocked had Mr. Gilman
even hinted that there was such a word in the dictionary.
But not being, after all, a nice girl, she actually dwelt on
the notion of marriage with somebody exactly like Mr.
Gilman. She imagined how fine and comfortable and final
it would be. She admitted that despite her riches and her
independence she would be and could be simply naught until
she possessed a man and could show him to the world as
her own. Strange attitude for a wealthy feminist, but she
had the attitude! And, moreover, she enjoyed having it;
she revelled in it. She desired, impatiently, that Mr.
Gilman should proceed further. She thirsted for his next
remark. And her extremely deceptive features displayed
only a blend of simplicity and soft pity. Those features did
not actually lie, for she was ingenuous without being aware
of it and her pity for the fellow-creature whose lot she could
assuage with a glance was real enough. But they did
suppress about nine-tenths of the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, &#8220;there is nothing I could
not say to you. And&mdash;and&mdash;of course, you&#8217;ll say I scarcely
know you&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearly he was proceeding further. She waited as
in a theatre one waits for a gun to go off on the stage.
And then the gun did go off, but not the gun she was
expecting.</p>

<p>Skipper Wyatt&#8217;s head popped up like a cannon shot out
of a hole in the forward deck, and it gazed sharply and
apprehensively around the calm, moonlit sea. Mr. Gilman
was, beyond question, perturbed by the movements of that
head, though he could not see the expression of the eyes.
This was the first phenomenon. The second phenomenon
was a swirling of water round the after part of the ship, and
this swirling went on until the water was white with a thin
foam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reverse those d&mdash;&mdash;d engines!&#8221; shouted Captain
Wyatt, quite regardless of the proximity of refined women.
He had now sprung clear of the hole and was running aft.
The whole world of the yacht could not but see that he was
coatless and that his white shirtsleeves, being rather long,
were kept in position by red elastic rings round his arms.
&#8220;Is that blithering engineer asleep?&#8221; continued Captain
Wyatt, ignoring the whole system of yacht etiquette.
&#8220;She&#8217;s getting harder on every second!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, skipper!&#8221; came a muffled voice from the engine-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And not too soon either!&#8221; snapped the captain.</p>

<p>The yacht throbbed more violently; the swirling increased
furiously. The captain stared over the rail. Then,
after an interval, he stamped on the deck in disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut off!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;It&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yacht ceased to throb. The swirling came to an
end, and the thin white foam faded into flat sombre water.
Whereupon Captain Wyatt turned back to the wheel, which,
in his extreme haste, he had passed by.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve run her on to the sand, sir,&#8221; said he to Mr.
Gilman, respectfully but still accusingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Impossible!&#8221; Mr. Gilman defended himself,
pained by the charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hard on, anyhow, sir. And many a good yacht&#8217;s
left her bones on this Buxey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you gave me the course,&#8221; protested Mr. Gilman,
with haughtiness.</p>

<p>Captain Wyatt bent down and looked at the binnacle.
He was contentedly aware that the compass of a yacht hard
aground cannot lie and cannot be made to lie. The camera
can lie; the speedometer of an automobile after an accident
can lie&mdash;or can conceal the truth and often does, but the
compass of a yacht aground is insusceptible to any
blandishment; it shows the course at the moment of striking
and nothing will persuade it to alter its evidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What course did I give you, sir?&#8221; asked Captain
Wyatt.</p>

<p>And as Mr. Gilman hesitated in his reply, the skipper
pointed silently to the compass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the chart? Let me see the chart,&#8221; said Mr.
Gilman with sudden majesty.</p>

<p>The chart in its little brass frame was handy. Mr.
Gilman examined it in a hostile manner; one might say that
he cross-examined it, and with it the horizon. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he
muttered at length, peering at the print under the chart,
&#8220;&#8216;Corrected 1906.&#8217; Out of date. Pity they don&#8217;t re-issue
these charts oftener.&#8221;</p>

<p>His observations had no relation whatever to the matter
in hand; considered as a contribution to the unravelling of
the matter in hand they were merely idiotic. Nevertheless,
such were the exact words he uttered, and he appeared to
get great benefit and solace from them. They somehow
enabled him to meet, quite satisfactorily, the gaze of his
guests who had now gathered in the vicinity of the wheel.</p>

<p>Audrey alone showed a desire to move away from the
wheel. The fact was that the skipper had glanced at her
in a peculiar way and his eyes had seemed to say, with
disdain: &#8220;Women! Women again!&#8221; Nothing but that!
The implications, however, were plain. Audrey may have
been discountenanced by the look in the captain&#8217;s eyes, but
at the same time she had an inward pride, because it was
undeniable that Mr. Gilman, owing to his extreme and
agitated interest in herself, had put the yacht off the course
and was thereby imperilling numerous lives. Audrey liked
that. And she exonerated Mr. Gilman, and she hated the
captain for daring to accuse him, and she mysteriously
nursed the wounded dignity of Mr. Gilman far better than
he could nurse it himself.</p>

<p>Her feelings were assuredly complex, and they grew
more complex when the sense of danger began to dominate
them. The sense of danger came to her out of the
demeanour of her companions and out of the swift appearance
on deck of every member of the crew, including the
parlourmaid, and including three men who were incompletely
clothed. The yacht was no longer a floating hotel,
automobile and dancing-saloon; it was a stranded wreck.
Not a passenger on board knew whether the tide was
making or ebbing, but, secretly, all were convinced that it
was ebbing and that they would be left on the treacherous
sand and ultimately swallowed up therein, even if a storm
did not supervene and smash the craft to bits in the classical
manner. The skipper&#8217;s words about the bones of many a
good yacht had escaped no ear.</p>

<p>Further, not a passenger knew where the yacht was or
whither, exactly, she was bound or whether the glass was
rising or falling, for guests on yachts seldom concern themselves
about details. Of course, signals might be made to
passing ships, but signals were often, according to maritime
history, unheeded, and the ocean was very large and empty,
though it was only the German Ocean.... Musa was
nervous and angry. Audrey knew from her intimate knowledge
of him that he was angry and she wondered why he
should be angry. Madame Piriac, on the other hand, was
entirely calm. Her calmness seemed to say to those
responsible, and even to the not-responsible passenger:
&#8220;You got me into this and it is inconceivable that you should
not get me out of it. I have always been looked after and
protected, and I must be looked after and protected now.
I absolutely decline to be worried.&#8221; But Miss Thompkins
was worried, she was very seriously alarmed; fear was in
her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do think it&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; she broke out almost loudly,
in a trembling voice, to Audrey. &#8220;I do think it&#8217;s a shame
you should go flirting with poor Mr. Gilman when he&#8217;s steering.&#8221;
And she meant all she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me flirting!&#8221; Audrey exclaimed, passionately resentful.</p>

<p>Withal, the sense of danger continued to increase. Still
there were the boats. There were the motor-launch, the
cutter and the dinghy. The sea was&mdash;for the present&mdash;calm
and the moon encouraging.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower the dinghy there and look lively now!&#8221; cried
the captain.</p>

<p>This command more than ever frightened all the
passengers who, in their nervousness and alarm, had tried
to pretend to themselves that nervousness and alarm were
absurd, and that first-class yachts never did, and could not,
get wrecked. The command was a thunderstroke. It
proved that the danger was immediate and intense. And
the thought of all the beautiful food and drink on board,
and all the soft cushions and the electric hair-curlers and the
hot-water supply and the ice gave no consolation whatever.
The idea of the futility and wickedness of luxury desolated
the guests and made them austere, and yet even in that
moment they speculated upon what goods they might take
with them.</p>

<p>And why the dinghy, though it was a dinghy of large
size? Why not the launch?</p>

<p>After the dinghy had been dropped into the sea an old
sail was carefully spread amidships over her bottom and she
was lugged, by her painter, towards the bow of the yacht
where, with much grating of windlasses and of temperaments
and voices, an anchor was very gently lowered into her and
rested on the old sail. The anchor was so immense that it
sank the dinghy up to Her gunwale, and then she was
rowed away to a considerable distance, a chain grinding
after her, and in due time the anchor was pitched with a
great splash into the water. The sound of orders and of
replies vibrated romantically over the surface of the water.
Then a windlass was connected with the engine, and the
passengers comprehended that the intention was to drag
the yacht off the sand by main force. The chain clacked
and strained horribly. The shouting multiplied, as though
the vessel had been a great beast that could be bullied into
obedience. The muscles of all passengers were drawn taut
in sympathy with the chain, and at length there was a lurch
and the chain gradually slackened.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s off!&#8221; breathed the captain. &#8220;We&#8217;ve saved a
good half-hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d have floated off by herself,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman
grandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;But if it had happened
to be the ebb, sir&mdash;&#8221; He left it at that and began on a
new series of orders, embracing the dinghy, the engines, the
anchor and another anchor.</p>

<p>And all the passengers resumed their courage and their
ancient notions about the excellence of luxury, and came to
the conclusion that navigation was a very simple affair, and
in less than five minutes were sincerely convinced that they
had never known fear.</p>

<p>Later, the impressive sight was witnessed of Madame
Piriac, on her shoulders such a cloak as certainly had never
been seen on a yacht before, bearing Mr. Gilman&#8217;s valuable
violin like a jewel casket. She had found it below and
brought it up on deck.</p>

<p>The <em>Ariadne</em>, was now passing to port those twinkling
cities of delight, Clacton and Frinton, and the long pier of
Walton stretched out towards it, a string of topazes. The
moon was higher and brighter than ever, but clouds had
heaped themselves up to windward, and the surface of the
water was rippled. Moreover, the yacht was now working
over a strong, foul tide. The company, with the exception
of Mr. Gilman, who had gone below&mdash;apparently in order
to avoid being on the same deck with Captain Wyatt&mdash;had
decided that Musa should be asked to play. Although the
sound of his practising had escaped occasionally through
the porthole of a locked cabin, he had not once during
the cruise performed for the public benefit. Dancing was
finished. Why should not the yacht profit by the presence
of a great genius on board? The doctor and the
secretary were of one mind with the women that there
was no good answer to this question, and even the crew
obviously felt that the genius ought to show what he was
made of.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dare we ask you?&#8221; said Madame Piriac to the youth,
offering him the violin case. Her supplicatory tone and
attitude, though they were somewhat assumed, proved to
what a height Musa had recently risen as a personage.</p>

<p>He hesitated, leaning against the rail and nervously
fingering it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is a great deal to ask. But you would give
us so much pleasure,&#8221; said Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>Musa replied in a dry, curt voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should prefer not to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! But Musa&mdash;&#8221; There was a general protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot play,&#8221; Musa exclaimed with impatience, and
moved almost savagely away.</p>

<p>The experience was novel for Madame Piriac, left
standing there, as it were, respectfully presenting the
violin case to the rail. This beautiful and not unpampered
lady was accustomed to see her commands received as an
honour; and when she condescended to implore, the effect
usually was to produce a blissful and deprecatory confusion
in the person besought. Her husband and Mr. Gilman had
for a number of years been teaching her that whatever
she desired was the highest good and the most complete
felicity to everybody concerned in the fulfilment of the
desire. She bore the blow from Musa admirably, keeping
both her smile and her dignity, and with one gesture
excusing Musa to all beholders as a capricious and a
sensitive artist in whom moodiness was lawful. It was
exquisitely done. It could not have been better done. But
not even Madame Piriac&#8217;s extreme skill could save the
episode from having the air of a social disaster. The
gaiety which had been too feverishly resumed after the
salvage of the yacht from the sandbank expired like a
pricked balloon. People silently vanished, and only Audrey
was left on the after deck.</p>

<p>It was after a long interval that she became aware
of the reappearance of Musa. Seemingly, he had been in
the engine-room; since the beginning of the cruise he had
shown a fancy for both the engine-room and the engineer.
To her surprise, he marched straight towards her deckchair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must speak to you,&#8221; he said with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must you?&#8221; Audrey replied, full of hot resentment.
&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve been horrid, Musa. Perfectly horrid! But
I suppose you have your own notions of politeness now.
Everything has been done for you, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; he stopped her. &#8220;Everything has
been done for me. What is it that has been done for
me? I play for years, I am ignored. Then I succeed.
I am noticed. Men of affairs offer me immense sums.
But am I surprised? Not the least in the world. It is
the contrary which would have surprised me. It was
inevitable that I should succeed. But note well&mdash;it is I
myself who succeed. It is not my friends. It is not
the concert agent. Do I regard the concert agent as a
benefactor? Again, not the least in the world. You say
everything has been done for me. Nothing has been done
for me, Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; faltered Audrey, who was in a dilemma,
and therefore more resentful than ever. &#8220;I&mdash;I only mean
your friends have always stood by you.&#8221; She gathered
courage, sat up erect in her deck-chair, and finished
haughtily: &#8220;And now you&#8217;re conceited. You&#8217;re insufferably
conceited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I refused to play?&#8221; He laughed stridently
and grimly. &#8220;No. I refused to play because I could
not, because I was outside myself with jealousy. Yes,
jealousy. You do not know jealousy. Perhaps you
are incapable of it. But permit me to tell you, Madame,
that jealousy is one of the finest and most terrible emotions.
And that is why I must speak to you. I cannot live
and see you flirt so seriously with that old idiot. I
cannot live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey jumped up from the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa! I shall never speak to you again.... Me ...
flirt.... And you call Mr. Gilman an old idiot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What words would you employ, Madame? He was
so agitated by your intimate conversation that he brought
us all near to death, in any case. Moreover, it jumps
to the eyes that the decrepit satyr is mad about you.
Mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Musa&#8217;s voice broke. In the midst of all her fury
Audrey was relieved that it did break, for the reason that
it was getting very loud, and the wheel, with Captain
Wyatt thereat, was not far off.</p>

<p>There was one thing to do, and Audrey did it. She
walked away rapidly. And, as she did so, she was startled
to discover a sob in her throat. The drawn, highly
emotionalised face of Musa remained with her. She was
angry, indignant, infuriated, and yet her feelings were
not utterly unpleasant, though she wanted them to be so.
In the first place, they were exciting. And in the second
place&mdash;what was it?&mdash;well, she had the strange, sweet
sensation of being, somehow, the mainspring of the universe,
of being immensely important in the scheme of things.</p>

<p>She thought her cup was full. It was not. Staring
blankly over the side of the ship she saw a buoy float
slowly by. She saw it with the utmost clearness, and on
its round black surface was painted in white letters the
word &#8220;Flank.&#8221; There could not be two Flank buoys. It
was the Flank buoy of the Mozewater navigable channel.
... She glanced around. The well-remembered shores of
Mozewater were plainly visible under the moon. In the
distance, over the bowsprit, she could discern the mass
of the tower of Mozewater church. She could not distinguish
Flank Hall, but she knew it was there. Why
were they threading the Mozewater channel? It had been
distinctly given out that the yacht would make Harwich
harbour. Almost unconsciously she turned in the direction
of the wheel, where Captain Wyatt was. Then, controlling
herself, she moved away. She knew that she could not
speak to the captain. She went below, and, before she
could escape, found the saloon populated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mrs. Moncreiff!&#8221; cried Madame Piriac. &#8220;It is
a miraculous coincidence. You will never guess. One tells
me we are going to the village of Moze for the night;
it is because of the tide. You remember, I told you. It
is where lives my little friend, Audrey Moze. To-morrow
I visit her, and you must come with me. I insist that
you come with me. I have never seen her. It will be
all that is most palpitating.&#8221;</p>




<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_33" id="chapter_33" />CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>


<h3>AGUILAR&#8217;S DOUBLE LIFE</h3>

<p>Madame Piriac came down into the saloon the next
afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You are still hiding yourself here!&#8221; she murmured
gaily to Audrey, who was alone among the cushions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just resting,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;Remember what
a night we had!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true that the yacht had not been berthed at
Lousey Hard until between two and three o&#8217;clock in the
morning, and that no guest had slept until after the job
was done, though more than one had tried to sleep. It
was also true that in consequence the saloon breakfast
had been abrogated, that even the saloon lunch lacked
vicacity, and that at least one passenger was at that
moment dozing in his cabin. But not on account of fatigue
and somnolence was Audrey remaining in the saloon instead
of taking the splendid summer afternoon on deck under
the awning. She felt neither tired nor sleepy. The true
secret was that she feared the crowd of village idlers,
quidnuncs, tattlers and newsmongers who all day gazed
from Lousey Hard at the wonder-yacht.</p>

<p>Examining the line of faces as well as she could through
portholes, she recognised nearly every one of them, and
was quite sure that every one of them would recognise her
face. To go ashore or to stay prominently on deck would,
therefore, be to give away her identity and to be forced,
sooner or later, to admit that she had practised a long
and naughty deception. She could conceive some of those
villagers greeting her loudly from the Hard if she should
appear; for Essex manners were marked by strange freedoms.
Her situation would be terrible. It, in fact, was terrible.
Risks surrounded her like angry dogs. Musa, for example,
ought surely to have noticed that the estuary in which
the yacht lay was the same estuary which he had seen
not long before from the garden of the house stated by
Audrey to be her own, and he ought to have commented
eagerly on the marvellous coincidence. Happily, he had
not yet done so&mdash;no doubt because he had spent most of
the time in bed. If and when he did so there would naturally
be an excited outcry and a heavy rain of amazed questions
which simply could not be answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going almost at once to call on my little friend
Audrey Moze, at Flank Hall,&#8221; said Madame Piriac. &#8220;The
house looks delicious from the deck. If you will come
up I will show it to you. It is precisely like the picture
post card which the dear little one sent to me last year.
Are you ready to come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, darling, hadn&#8217;t you better go alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But certainly not, darling! You are not serious.
The meeting will be very agitating. With a third person,
however, it will be less so. I count on you absolutely,
as I have said already. Nay, I insist. I invoke your
friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may be out. She may be away altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case we shall return,&#8221; said Madame Piriac
briefly, and, not giving Audrey time to reply further, she
vanished, with a firm carriage and an obstinate look in
her eyes, towards the sleeping-cabins.</p>

<p>The next instant Mr. Gilman himself entered the saloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Moncreiff,&#8221; he started nervously, in a confidential
and deprecating tone, &#8220;this is the first chance I have had
to tell you. We came into Mozewater without my orders.
I won&#8217;t say against my orders, but certainly not with them.
On the plea that I had retired, Captain Wyatt changed
our destination last night without going through the formality
of consulting me. We ought to have made Harwich,
but I am now told that we were running short of paraffin,
and that if we had continued to Harwich we should have
had the worst of the tide against us, whereas in coming
up Mozewater the tide helped us; also that Captain Wyatt
did not care about trying to get into Harwich harbour at
night with the wind in its present quarter, and rising as
it was then. Of course, Wyatt is responsible for the
safety of the ship, and it is true that I had her designed
with a very light draught on purpose for such waters as
Mozewater; but he ought to have consulted me. We might
get away again on this tide, but Hortense will not hear
of it. She has a call to pay, she says. I can only tell you
how sorry I am. And I do hope you will forgive me.&#8221; The
sincerity and alarm of his manly apology were touching.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Gilman,&#8221; said Audrey, with the simplicity
which more and more she employed in talking to her host,
&#8220;there is nothing to forgive. What can it matter to me
whether we come here or go to Harwich?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought, I was afraid&mdash;&#8221; Mr. Gilman hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;In short ... your secret, Mrs. Moncreiff, which you
asked me to keep, and which I have kept. It was here,
at this very spot, with my old barge-yacht, that I first
had the pleasure of meeting you. And I thought ...
perhaps you had reasons.... However, your secret is
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice you are, Mr. Gilman!&#8221; Audrey said, with
a gentle smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re kindness itself. But there is
nothing to trouble about, really. Keep my little secret by
all means, if you don&#8217;t mind. As for anything else&mdash;that&#8217;s
perfectly all right.... Shall we go on deck?&#8221;</p>

<p>He thanked her without words.</p>

<p>She was saying to herself, rather desperately:</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, what do I care? I haven&#8217;t committed a
crime. It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business but my own. And I&#8217;m
worth ten million francs. And if the fat&#8217;s in the fire, and
anything is found out, and people don&#8217;t like it&mdash;well, they
must do the other thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus she went on deck, and her courage was rewarded
by the discovery of a chair on the starboard side of the
deck-house, from which she could not possibly be seen by
any persons on the Hard. She took this chair like a gift
from heaven. The deck was busy enough. Mr. Price,
the secretary, was making entries in an account book.
Dr. Cromarty was pacing to and fro, expectant. Captain
Wyatt was arguing with the chauffeur of a vast motor-van
from Clacton, and another motor-van from Colchester was
also present on the Hard. Rows of paraffin cans were
ranged against the engine-room hatchway, and the odour
of paraffin was powerfully conflicting with the odour of
ozone and possibly ammonia from the marshes. Parcels
kept coming down by hand from the village of Moze. Fresh
water also came in barrels on a lorry, and lumps of ice
in a dog-cart. The arrival of six bottles of aspirin, brought
by a heated boy on a bicycle, from Clacton, and seized
with gusto by Dr. Cromarty, completed the proof that
money will not only buy anything, but will infallibly draw
it to any desired spot, however out of the way the spot
may be. The probability was that neither paraffin nor ice
nor aspirin had ever found itself on Lousey Hard before
in the annals of the world. Yet now these things forgathered
with ease and naturalness owing to the magic
of the word &#8220;yacht&#8221; in telegrams.</p>

<p>And over the scene floated the wavy, inspiring folds of
the yacht&#8217;s immense blue ensign, with the Union Jack in
the top inside corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Price went into the deck-house and began to count
money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Price,&#8221; demanded Mr. Gilman urgently, &#8220;did you
look up the facts about this village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just looking up the place in &#8216;East Coast Tours,&#8217;
sir, when the paraffin arrived,&#8221; replied Mr. Price. &#8220;It says
that Moze is mentioned in &#8216;Green&#8217;s Short History of the
English People.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Very interesting. That work is a classic. It
really treats of the English people, and not solely of their
kings and queens. Dr. Cromarty, Mr. Price is busy, will
you mind bringing me the catalogue of the library up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Cromarty obeyed, and Mr. Gilman examined the
typewritten, calf-bound volume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Yes. I thought we had Green on
board, and we have. I should like extremely to know what
Green says about Moze. It must have been in the Anglo-Saxon
or Norman period. Dr. Cromarty, will you mind
bringing me up the first three volumes of Green? You
will find them on shelf Z8. Also the last volume, for the
index.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later Mr. Gilman, with three volumes of
Green on his knees and one in his hand, said reproachfully
to Mr. Price:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Price, I requested you to see that the leaves of
all our books were cut. These volumes are absolutely
uncut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I&#8217;m working through them as fast as I can.
But I haven&#8217;t got to shelf Z8 yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot stop to cut them now,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman,
politely displeased. &#8220;What a pity! It would have been
highly instructive to know what Green says about Moze.
I always like to learn everything I can about the places we
stop at. And this place must be full of historic interest.
Wyatt, have you had that paraffin counted properly?&#8221; He
spoke very coldly to the captain.</p>

<p>It thus occurred that what John Richard Green
said about Moze was never known on board the yacht
<em>Ariadne</em>.</p>

<p>Audrey listened to the episode in a reverie. She was
thinking about Musa&#8217;s intractability and inexcusable rudeness,
and about what she should do in the matter of Madame
Piriac&#8217;s impending visit to Audrey Moze at Flank Hall, and
through the texture of these difficult topics she could see,
as it were, shining the sprightly simplicity, the utter ingenuousness,
the entirely reliable fidelity of Mr. Gilman.
She felt, rather than consciously realised, that he was a dull
man. But she liked his dullness; it reassured her; it was
tranquillising; it was even adorable. She liked also his
attitude towards Moze. She had never suspected, no one
had ever hinted to her, that Moze was full of historic interest.
But looking at it now from the yacht which had miraculously
wafted her past the Flank buoy at dead of night, she perceived
Moze in a quite new aspect&mdash;a pleasure which she
owed to Mr. Gilman&#8217;s artless interest in things. (Not that
he was artless in all affairs! No; in the great masculine
affairs he must be far from artless, for had he not made all
his money himself?)</p>

<p>Then Madame Piriac appeared on deck, armed and determined.
Audrey found, as hundreds of persons had found,
that it was impossible to deny Madame Piriac. Beautiful,
gracious, elegant, kind, when she would have a thing she
would have it. Audrey had to descend and prepare herself.
She had to reascend ready for the visit. But at the critical
and dreadful moment of going ashore to affront the crowd
she had a saving idea. She pointed to Flank Hall and its
sloping garden, and to the sea-wall against which the high
spring tide was already washing, and she suggested that
they should be rowed thither in the dinghy instead of
walking around by the sea-wall or through&#8217; the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we cannot climb over that dyke,&#8221; Madame Piriac
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we can,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;I can see steps in
it from here, and I can see a gate at the bottom of the
garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a vision you have, darling!&#8221; murmured Madame
Piriac. &#8220;As you wish, provided we get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dinghy, at Audrey&#8217;s request, was brought round
to the side of the yacht opposite from the Hard, and,
screening her face as well as she could with an open
parasol, she tripped down by the steps into it. If only
Aguilar was away from the premises she might be saved,
for the place would be shut up, and there would be nothing
to do but return. Should Madame Piriac suggest going into
the village to inquire&mdash;well, Audrey would positively refuse
to go into the village. Yes, she would refuse!</p>

<p>As the boat moved away from the yacht, Musa showed
himself on deck. Madame Piriac signalled to him a salutation
of the finest good humour. She had forgotten his
pettishness. By absolutely ignoring it she had made it as
though it had never existed. This was her art. Audrey,
observing the gesture, and Musa&#8217;s smiling reply to it,
acquired wisdom. She saw that she must treat Musa as
Madame Piriac treated him. She had undertaken the enterprise
of launching him on a tremendous artistic career, and
she must carry it through. She wanted to make a neat,
clean job of the launching, and she would do it dispassionately,
like a good workwoman. He had admitted&mdash;nay, he
had insisted&mdash;that she was necessary to him. Her pride in
that fact had a somewhat superior air. He might be the
most marvellous of violinists, but he was also a child, helpless
without her moral support. She would act accordingly.
It was absurd to be angry with a child, no matter what his
vagaries.... At this juncture of her reflections she noticed
that Mr. Gilman and Miss Thompkins had quitted the yacht
together and were walking seawards. They seemed very
intimate, impregnated with mutual understanding. And
Audrey was sorry that Mr. Gilman was quite so simple,
quite so straightforward and honest.</p>

<p>When the dinghy arrived at the sea-wall Audrey won
the stalled admiration of the sailor in charge of the boat by
pointing at once to the best&mdash;if not the only&mdash;place fit for a
landing. The sailor was by no means accustomed to such
<em>flair</em> in a yacht&#8217;s guests. Indeed, it had often astonished him
that people who, as a class, had so little notion of how to
get into or out of a dinghy could have succeeded, as they
all apparently had, in any department of life.</p>

<p>With continuing skill, Audrey guided Madame Piriac
over the dyke and past sundry other obstacles, including a
watercourse, to a gate in the wall which formed the frontier
of the grounds of Flank Hall. The gate seemed at first to
be unopenably fastened, but Audrey showed that she
possessed a genius with gates, and opened it with a twist
of the hand. They wandered through a plantation and then
through an orchard, and at length saw the house. There
was not a sign of Aguilar, but the unseen yard-dog began
to bark, hearing which, Madame Piriac observed in French:
&#8220;The property seems a little neglected, but there must
be someone at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar is bound to come now!&#8221; thought Audrey.
&#8220;And I am lost!&#8221; Then she added to herself: &#8220;And I
don&#8217;t care if I <em>am</em> lost. What an unheard-of lark!&#8221;
And to Madame Piriac she said lightly:
&#8220;Well, we must explore.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blinds were nearly all up on the garden front. And
one window&mdash;the French window of the drawing-room&mdash;was
wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;The crisis will be here in one minute at the latest,&#8221;
thought Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently Miss Moze is at home,&#8221; said Madame Piriac,
gazing at the house. &#8220;Yes, it is distinguished. It is what
I had expected.... But ought we not to go to the front
door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we ought,&#8221; Audrey agreed.</p>

<p>They went round the side of the house, into the main
drive, and without hesitation Madame Piriac rang the front
door bell, which they could plainly hear. &#8220;I must have my
cards ready,&#8221; said she, opening her bag. &#8220;One always
hears how exigent you are in England about such details,
even in the provinces. And, indeed, why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer to the bell. Madame Piriac rang
again, and there was still no answer. And the dog had
ceased to bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Mon Dieu!</em>&#8220; she muttered. &#8220;Have you observed,
darling, that all the blinds are down on this façade?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rang a third time. Then, without a word, they
returned slowly to the garden front.</p>

<p>&#8220;How mysterious! <em>Mon Dieu!</em> How English it all
is!&#8221; muttered Madame Piriac. &#8220;It gives me fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey had almost decided definitely that she was saved
when she happened to glance through the open window of
the drawing-room. She thought she saw a flicker within.
She looked again. She could not be mistaken. Then she
noticed that all the dust sheets had been removed from the
furniture, that the carpet had been laid, that a table had
been set for tea, that there were flowers and china and a
teapot and bread-and-butter and a kettle and a spirit-lamp
on the table. The flicker was the flicker of the blue flame
of the spirit-lamp. The kettle over it was puffing out steam.</p>

<p>Audrey exclaimed, within herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had caught him at last. There were two cups and
saucers&mdash;the best ancient blue-and-white china, out of the
glass-fronted china cupboard in that very room! The
celibate Aguilar, never known to consort with anybody at
all, was clearly about to entertain someone to tea, and the
aspect of things showed that he meant to do it very well.
True, there was no cake, but the bread-and-butter was
expertly cut and attractively arranged. Audrey felt sure
that she was on the track of Aguilar&#8217;s double life, and that
a woman was concerned therein. She was angry, but she
was also enormously amused and uplifted. She no longer
cared the least bit about the imminent danger threatening
her incognito. Her sole desire was to entrap Aguilar, and
with deep joy she pictured his face when he should come into
the room with his friend and find the mistress of the house
already installed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better go in here, darling,&#8221; she said to
Madame Piriac, with her hand on the French window.
&#8220;There is no other entrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Eh bien!</em> It is your country, not mine. You know
the habits. I follow you,&#8221; said Madame Piriac calmly.
&#8220;After all, my dear little Audrey ought to be delighted to
see me. I have several times told her that I should come.
All the same, I expected to announce myself.... What a
charming room! So this is the English provinces!&#8221;</p>

<p>The room was certainly agreeable to the eye. And
Audrey seemed to see it afresh, to see it for the first time
in her life. And she thought: &#8220;Can this be the shabby old
drawing-room that I hated so?&#8221;</p>

<p>The kettle continued to puff vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t come soon,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;the water will
be all boiled away and the kettle burnt. Suppose we make
the tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your country,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;That appears to
be singular, but I have not the English habits.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she sat down, smiling.</p>

<p>Audrey opened the tea caddy, put three spoonfuls of tea
into the pot, and made the tea.</p>

<p>The clock struck on the mantelpiece. The clock was
actually going. Aguilar was ever thorough in his actions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four minutes to brew, and if they don&#8217;t come we&#8217;ll
have tea,&#8221; said Audrey, tranquil in the assurance that the
advent of Aguilar could not now be long delayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you take milk and sugar, darling?&#8221; she asked
Madame Piriac at the end of the four minutes, which they
had spent mainly in a curious silence. &#8220;I believe you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little bread-and-butter? I&#8217;m sorry there&#8217;s no cake
or jam.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was while Madame Piriac was stirring her first cup
that the drawing-room door opened, and at once there was
a terrific shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Audrey!&#8221;</p>

<p>The invader was Miss Ingate. Close behind Miss Ingate
came Jane Foley.</p>




<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_34" id="chapter_34" />CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>THE TANK-ROOM</h3>


<p>&#8221;Did you get my letter?&#8221; breathed Miss Ingate weakly,
after she had a little recovered from the shock, which had
the appearance of being terrific.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;How could I? We&#8217;re yachting.
Madame Piriac, you know Miss Ingate, don&#8217;t you? And
this is my friend Jane Foley.&#8221; She spoke quite easily and
naturally, though Miss Ingate in her intense agitation had
addressed her as Audrey, whereas the Christian name of
Mrs. Moncreiff, on the rare occasions when a Christian name
became necessary or advisable, had been Olivia&mdash;or, infrequently,
Olive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yachting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Haven&#8217;t you seen the yacht at the Hard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I did hear something about it, but I&#8217;ve been too
busy to run after yachts. We&#8217;ve been too busy, haven&#8217;t we,
Miss Foley? I even have to keep my dog locked up. I
don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ll say. Aud&mdash;Mrs. Moncreiff! I
really don&#8217;t! But we acted for the best. Oh! How
dreadfully exciting my life does get at times! Never since
I played the barrel organ all the way down Regent Street
have I&mdash;! Oh! dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have my tea, and do sit down, Winnie, and remember
you&#8217;re an Essex woman!&#8221; Audrey adjured her, going to
the china cupboard to get more cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I&#8217;ll</em> just tell you all about it, Mrs. Moncreiff, if you&#8217;ll
let me,&#8221; Jane Foley began with a serene and happy smile,
as she limped to a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite ready to take all the
consequences. It&#8217;s the police again, that&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t
know how exactly they got on the track of the Spatts at
Frinton. But I dare say you&#8217;ve seen that the police have
seized a lot of documents at our head-quarters. Perhaps
that explains it. Anyway I caught sight of our old friend
at Paget Gardens nosing about, and so as soon as it was
dark I left the Spatts. It&#8217;s a horrid thing to say, but I
never was so glad about anything as I was at leaving the
Spatts. I didn&#8217;t tell them where I was going, and they
didn&#8217;t ask. I&#8217;m sure the poor things were very relieved to
have me go. Miss Ingate tells me to-day she&#8217;s heard they&#8217;ve
both resigned from the Union. Mr. Spatt went up to
London on purpose to do it. And can you be surprised?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can, and yet you can&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Ingate. &#8220;You can, and yet you can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Miss Ingate on Frinton front,&#8221; Jane Foley proceeded.
&#8220;She was just getting into her carriage. I had
my bag and I asked her to drive me to the station. &#8216;To the
station?&#8217; she said. &#8216;What for? There&#8217;s no train to-night.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more there wasn&#8217;t!&#8221; Miss Ingate put in, &#8220;I&#8217;d been
dining at the Proctors&#8217; and it was after ten, I know it was
after ten because they never let me leave until after ten, in
spite of the long drive I have. Fancy there being a train
from Frinton after ten! So of course I brought Miss Foley
along. Oh! It was vehy interesting. Vehy interesting.
You see we had to think of the police. I didn&#8217;t want the
police coming poking round my house. It would never do,
in a little place like Moze. I should never hear the last of
it. So I&mdash;I thought of Flank Hall. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane Foley went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ingate was sure you wouldn&#8217;t mind, Mrs. Moncreiff.
And personally I was quite certain you wouldn&#8217;t
mind. We left the carriage at Miss Ingate&#8217;s, and carried
the bag in turns. And I stood outside while Miss Ingate
woke up Mr. Aguilar. It was soon all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say Aguilar was vehy reasonable,&#8221; said Miss
Ingate. &#8220;Vehy reasonable. And he&#8217;s got a great spite
against my dear Inspector Keeble. He suggested everything.
He never asked any questions, so I told him. You
do, you know. He suggested Miss Foley should have a
bed in the tank-room, so that if there was any trouble all
the bedrooms should look innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he tell you I&#8217;d come here to see him not long
since?&#8221; Audrey demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why didn&#8217;t you pop in to see <em>me?</em> I was hurt
when I got your note.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he didn&#8217;t. He never tells anybody anything.
That sort of thing&#8217;s very useful at times, especially when
it&#8217;s combined with a total lack of curiosity. He fixed every,
thing up. And he keeps the gates locked, so that people
can&#8217;t wander in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t lock the gate at the bottom of the garden,
because it won&#8217;t lock,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;And so he didn&#8217;t
keep me from wandering in.&#8221; She felt rather disappointed
that Aguilar should once more have escaped her reproof and
that the dream of his double life should have vanished away,
but she was determined to prove that he was not perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said Miss Ingate.
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t startle me to hear that he knew you were intending
to come. All I know is that Miss Foley&#8217;s been
here for several days. Not a soul knows except me and
Aguilar. And it seems to get safer every day. She does
venture about the house now, though she never goes into
the garden while it&#8217;s light. It was Aguilar had the idea
of putting this room straight for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was he who cut the bread-and-butter,&#8221; added
Jane Foley.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this was to be our first tea-party!&#8221; Miss Ingate
half shrieked. &#8220;I&#8217;d come&mdash;I do come, you know, to keep
an eye on things as you asked me&mdash;I&#8217;d come, and we were
just having a cosy little chat in the tank-room. Aguilar&#8217;s
gone to Colchester to get a duplicate key of the front gates.
He left me his, so I could get in and lock up after myself,
and he put the water on to boil before leaving. I said to
Miss Foley, I said, up in the tank-room: &#8216;Was that a ring
at the door?&#8217; But she said it wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a little deaf since I was in prison,&#8221; said
Jane Foley.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now we come down and find you here! I&mdash;I hope
I&#8217;ve done right.&#8221; This, falteringly, from Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have, you silly old thing,&#8221; Audrey
reassured her. &#8220;It&#8217;s splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever I think of the police I laugh,&#8221; said Miss
Ingate in an unsettled voice. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. They can&#8217;t
possibly suspect. And they&#8217;re looking everywhere, everywhere!
I can&#8217;t help laughing.&#8221; And suddenly she burst
into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Now! Winnie, dear. Don&#8217;t spoil it all!&#8221;
Audrey protested, jumping up.</p>

<p>Madame Piriac, who had hitherto maintained the most
complete passivity, restrained her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave her tranquil!&#8221; murmured Madame Piriac in
French. &#8220;She is not spoiling it. On the contrary! One is
content to see that she is a woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Miss Ingate laughed, and blushed, and called
herself names.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you haven&#8217;t had my letter,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I wish
you had had it. But what is this yachting business? I
never heard of such goings-on. Is it your yacht? This
world is getting a bit too wonderful for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer to these questions was cut short by rather
heavy masculine footsteps approaching the door of the
drawing-room. Miss Ingate grew instantly serious. Audrey
and Jane looked at each other, and Jane Foley went quickly
but calmly to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! It&#8217;s Mr. Aguilar&mdash;returned!&#8221; she said, quietly.
&#8220;Is anything the matter, Mr. Aguilar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aguilar, hat in hand, entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Aguilar,&#8221; Audrey greeted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Noon, madam,&#8221; he responded, exactly as though he
had been expecting to find the mistress there. &#8220;It&#8217;s like
this. I&#8217;ve just seen Inspector Keeble and that there detective
as was here afore&mdash;<em>you</em> know, madam&#8221; (nodding to
Audrey) &#8220;and I fancy they&#8217;re a-coming this way, so I
thought I&#8217;d better cut back and warn ye. I don&#8217;t think they
saw me. I was too quick for &#8217;em. Was the bread-and-butter
all right, Miss Ingate? Thank ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate had risen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to go home,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel sure it would
be wiser for me to go home. I never could talk to
detectives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane Foley snatched at one of the four cups and saucers
on the table, and put it back, all unwashed, into the china
cupboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cups will be enough for them to see, if they
come,&#8221; she said, with a bright, happy smile to Audrey.
&#8220;Yes, Miss Ingate, you go home. I&#8217;m ever so much
obliged to you. Now, I&#8217;ll go upstairs and Aguilar shall
lock me in the tank-room and push the key under the door.
We are causing you a lot of trouble, Mrs. Moncreiff, but
you won&#8217;t mind. It might have been so much worse.&#8221; She
laughed as she went.</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose I meet those police on the way out, what
am I to say to them?&#8221; asked Miss Ingate when Jane Foley
and Aguilar had departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re very curious, tell them you&#8217;ve been here to
have tea with me and that Aguilar cut the bread-and-butter,&#8221;
Audrey replied. &#8220;The detective will be interested to see me.
He chased me all the way to London not long since. Au
revoir, Winnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear friend,&#8221; said Madame Piriac, with admirable
though false calm. &#8220;Would it not be more prudent to
fly back at once to the yacht&mdash;if in truth this is the same
police agent of whom you recounted to me with such
drollness the exploits? It is not that I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;There is no danger except to
Jane Foley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! You cannot abandon her. That is true. Nevertheless
I regret ...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, darling,&#8221; Audrey exclaimed. &#8220;You would insist
on my coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>The continuing presence of Miss Ingate, who had lost one
glove and her purse, rendered this brief conversation somewhat
artificial. And no sooner had Miss Ingate got away&mdash;by
the window, for the sake of dispatch&mdash;than a bell made
itself heard, and Aguilar came back to the drawing-room in
the rôle of butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inspector Keeble and a gentleman to see you, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring them in,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>Aguilar&#8217;s secret glance at Inspector Keeble as he brought
in the visitors showed that his lifelong and harmless enemy
had very little to hope from his goodwill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, you!&#8221; called the detective as Aguilar,
like a perfect butler, was vanishing. &#8220;Good afternoon,
ladies. Excuse me, I wish to question this man.&#8221; He
indicated Aguilar with a gesture of apologising for Aguilar.</p>

<p>Inspector Keeble, an overgrown mass of rectitude and
kindliness, greeted Audrey with that constraint which
always afflicted him when he was beneath any roof more
splendid than that of his own police-station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Aguilar,&#8221; said the detective, &#8220;it&#8217;s you that&#8217;ll be
telling me. Ye&#8217;ve got a woman concealed in the house.
Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew, then, this ferreting and divinatory Irishman!
Of course Miss Ingate must have committed some indiscretion,
or was it that Aguilar was less astute than he
gave the impression of being? Audrey considered that all
was lost, and she was aware of a most unpleasant feeling
of helplessness and inefficiency. Then she seemed to receive
inspiration and optimism from somewhere. She knew not
exactly from where, but perhaps it was from the shy stiffness
of the demeanour of her old acquaintance, Inspector Keeble.
Moreover, the Irishman&#8217;s twinkling eyes were a challenge
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Aguilar!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry to
hear this. I knew women were always your danger, but
I never dreamt you would start carrying on in my
absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aguilar fronted her, and their eyes met. Audrey gazed
at him steadily. There was no smile in Audrey&#8217;s eyes,
but there was a smile glimmering mysteriously behind
them, and after a couple of seconds this phenomenon
aroused a similar phenomenon behind the eyes of Aguilar.
Audrey had the terrible and god-like sensation of lifting
a hired servant to equality with herself. She imagined
that she would never again be able to treat him as Aguilar,
and she even feared that she would soon begin to cease
to hate him. At the same time she observed slight signs
of incertitude in the demeanour of the detective.</p>

<p>Aguilar replied coldly, not to Audrey, but to the
police:</p>

<p>&#8220;If Inspector Keeble or anybody else has been mixing
my name up with any scandal about females, I&#8217;ll have
him up for slander and libel and damages as sure as I
stand here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inspector Keeble looked away, and then looked at the
detective&mdash;as if for support in peril.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say, Aguilar, that you haven&#8217;t got
a woman hidden in the house at this very moment?&#8221; the
detective demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thank ye to keep a civil tongue in your head,&#8221;
said Aguilar. &#8220;Or I&#8217;ll take ye outside and knock yer face
sideways. Pardon me, madam. Of course I ain&#8217;t got no
woman concealed on the premises. And mark ye, if I
lose my place through this ye&#8217;ll hear of it. And I shall
put a letter in the <em>Gardeners&#8217; Chronicle</em>, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ye can go,&#8221; the detective responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sneered Aguilar. &#8220;I can go. Yes, and I shall
go. But not so far but what I can protect my interests.
And I&#8217;ll make this village too hot for Keeble before I&#8217;ve
done, police or no police.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a look at Audrey like the look of a knight
at his lady after a joust, Aguilar turned to leave the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar,&#8221; Audrey rewarded him. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be
afraid about your place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye, m&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask what your name is?&#8221; Audrey inquired of
the detective as soon as Aguilar had shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurley,&#8221; replied the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it might be,&#8221; said Audrey, sitting down,
but not offering seats. &#8220;Well, Mr. Hurley, after all your
running after Miss Susan Foley, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s rather
unfair to say horrid things about a respectable man like
Aguilar? You were funny about that stout wife of
yours last time I saw you, but you must remember that
Aguilar can&#8217;t be funny about his wife, because he hasn&#8217;t
got one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re driving at, miss,&#8221;
said Mr. Hurley simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what were you driving at when you followed
me all the way to London the other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Mr. Hurley, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t follow you to
London. I only happened to arrive at Charing Cross about
twenty seconds after you, that was all. As a matter of
fact, nearly half of the way you were following me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you were satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only want to know one thing,&#8221; the detective retorted.
&#8220;Am I speaking to Mrs. Olivia Moncreiff?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey hesitated, glancing at Madame Piriac, who, in
company with the vast Inspector Keeble, was carefully
inspecting the floor. She invoked wisdom and sagacity
from heaven, and came to a decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, if you please, who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Audrey. &#8220;You&#8217;re in the village
of Moze itself and you ask who I am. Everybody knows
me. My name is Audrey Moze, of Flank Hall, Moze,
Essex. Any child in Moze Street will tell you that. Inspector
Keeble knows as well as anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac proceeded steadily with the inquiry into
the carpet. Audrey felt her heart beating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unmarried?&#8221; pursued the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most decidedly,&#8221; said Audrey with conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the meaning of that ring on your finger,
if you don&#8217;t mind my asking?&#8221; the detective continued.</p>

<p>Certainly Audrey was flustered, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hurley,&#8221; said she; &#8220;I wear it as a protection
from men of all ages who are too enterprising.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke archly, with humour; but now there was no
answering humour in the features of Mr. Hurley, who
seemed to be a changed man, to be indeed no longer even
an Irishman. And Audrey grew afraid. Did he, after all,
know of her share in the Blue City enterprise? She had
long since persuaded herself that the police had absolutely
failed to connect her with that affair, but now uncertainty
was born in her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must search the house,&#8221; said the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to arrest a woman named Jane Foley,&#8221; answered
Mr. Hurley, adding somewhat grimly: &#8220;The name will be
known to ye, I&#8217;m thinking.... And I have reason to
believe that she is now concealed on these premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>The directness of the blow was terrific. It was almost
worse than the blow itself. And Audrey now believed
everything that she had ever heard or read about the
miraculous ingenuity of detectives. Still, she did not
regard herself as beaten, and the thought of the yacht
lying close by gave her a dim feeling of security. If she
could only procure delay!...</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let you search my house,&#8221; she said
angrily. &#8220;I never heard of such a thing! You&#8217;ve got
no right to search my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I have!&#8221; Mr. Hurley insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let me see your paper&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what you
call it. But I know you can&#8217;t do anything-without a
paper. Otherwise any bright young-man might walk into
my house and tell me he meant to search it. Keeble, I&#8217;m
really surprised at <em>you</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inspector Keeble blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, miss,&#8221; said he contritely. &#8220;But the
law&#8217;s the law. Show the lady your search-warrant, Mr.
Hurley.&#8221; His voice resembled himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Hurley coughed. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got a search-warrant
yet,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go and get one, then,&#8221; said Audrey,
calculating how long it would take three women to transport
themselves from the house to the yacht, and perpending
upon the probable behaviour of Mr. Gilman under a given
set of circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Mr. Hurley. &#8220;And I shan&#8217;t be long.
Keeble, where is the nearest justice of the peace?...
You&#8217;d better stay here or hereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got to go to the station to sign on my three constables,&#8221;
Inspector Keeble protested awkwardly, looking
at his watch, which also resembled himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stay here or hereabouts,&#8221; repeated Mr.
Hurley, and he moved towards the door. Inspector Keeble,
too, moved towards the door.</p>

<p>Audrey let them get into the passage, and then she
was vouchsafed a new access of inspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hurley,&#8221; she called, in a bright, unoffended tone.
&#8220;After all, I see no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t search the
house. I don&#8217;t really want to put you to any unnecessary
trouble. It is annoying, but I&#8217;m not going to be annoyed.&#8221;
The ingenuous young creature expected Mr. Hurley to be
at once disarmed and ashamed by this kind offer. She
was wrong. He was evidently surprised, but he gave no
evidence of shame or of the sudden death in his brain of
all suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; he said calmly. &#8220;And I&#8217;m much
obliged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come with you,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;Madame Piriac,&#8221;
she addressed Hortense with averted eyes. &#8220;Will you
excuse me for a minute or two while I show these gentlemen
the house?&#8221; The fact was that she did not care just
then to be left alone with Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I beg you, darling! &#8220;Madame Piriac granted
the permission with overpowering sweetness.</p>

<p>The procedure of Mr. Hurley was astonishing to Audrey;
nay, it was unnerving. First he locked the front door
and the garden door and pocketed the keys. Then he
locked the drawing-room on the passage side and pocketed
that key. He instructed Inspector Keeble to remain in
the hall at the foot of the stairs. He next went into the
kitchen and the sculleries and locked the outer doors in
that quarter. Then he descended to the cellars, with Audrey
always in his wake. Having searched the cellars and the
ground floor, he went upstairs, and examined in turn all
the bedrooms with a thoroughness and particularity which
caused Audrey to blush. He left nothing whatever to
chance, and no dust sheet was undisturbed. Audrey said
no word. The detective said no word. But Audrey kept
thinking: &#8220;He is getting nearer to the tank-room.&#8221; A
small staircase led to the attic floor, upon which were only
servants&#8217; bedrooms and the tank-room. After he had
mounted this staircase and gone a little way along the
passage he swiftly and without warning dashed back and
down the staircase. But nothing seemed to happen, and
he returned. The three doors of the three servants&#8217;
bedrooms were all ajar. Mr. Hurley passed each of them
with a careless glance within. At the end of the corridor,
in obscurity, was the door of the tank-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he asked abruptly. And he knocked
nonchalantly on the door of the tank-room.</p>

<p>Audrey was acutely alarmed lest Jane Foley should
respond, thinking the knock was that of a friend. She
saw how idiotic she had been not to warn Jane by means
of loud conversation with the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the tank-room,&#8221; she said loudly. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
it&#8217;s locked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; murmured Mr. Hurley negligently, and he turned
the searchlight of his gaze upon the three bedrooms, which
he examined as carefully as he had examined anything in
the house. The failure to discover in any cupboard or
corner even the shadow of a human being did not appear
to discourage him in the slightest degree. In the third
bedroom&mdash;that is to say, the one nearest the head of
the stairs and farthest from the tank-room&mdash;he suddenly
beckoned to Audrey, who was standing in the doorway.
She went within the room and he pushed the door to,
without, however, quite shutting it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now about the tank-room, Miss Moze,&#8221; he began
quietly. &#8220;You say it&#8217;s locked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the quaking Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of form I&#8217;d better just look in. Will
you kindly let me have the key?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey acquired tranquillity as she went on: &#8220;It&#8217;s at
Frinton. Friends of mine there keep a punt on Mozewater,
and I let them store the sail and things in
the tank-room. There&#8217;s plenty of room. I give them
the key because that&#8217;s more satisfactory. The tank-room
isn&#8217;t wanted at all, you see, while I&#8217;m away from
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are these friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Spatt,&#8221; said Audrey at a venture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the detective.</p>

<p>They came downstairs, and the detective made it known
that he would re-visit the drawing-room. Inspector Keeble
followed them. In that room Audrey remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I hope you&#8217;re satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hurley merely said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please ring for Aguilar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey complied. But she had to ring three times before
the gardener&#8217;s footsteps were heard on the uncarpeted stone
floor of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar,&#8221; Mr. Hurley demanded. &#8220;Where is the key
of the tank-room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey sank into a chair, knowing profoundly that
all was lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at Mrs. Spatt&#8217;s at Frinton,&#8221; replied Aguilar glibly.
&#8220;Mistress lets her have that room to store some boat-gear
in. I expected she&#8217;d ha&#8217; been over before this to get it
out. But the yachting season seems to start later and
later every year these times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey gazed at the man as at a miracle-worker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Mr. Hurley.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Audrey corrected him. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got all
my keys in your pocket&mdash;except one.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the police had gone Audrey said to Aguilar in
the hall:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar, how on earth did you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was in such a state of emotion at the realisation
of dangers affronted and past that she could not finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I was so long answering the bell, m&#8217;m,&#8221;
replied Aguilar strangely. &#8220;But I&#8217;d put my list slippers
on&mdash;them as your father made me wear when I come into
the house, mornings, to change the plants, and I thought
it better to put my boots on again before I come....
Shall I put the keys back in the doors, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he touched his front hair, after his manner,
and took the keys and retired. Audrey was as full of
fear as of gratitude. Aguilar daunted her.</p>




<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_35" id="chapter_35" />CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>THE THIRD SORT OF WOMAN</h3>


<p>&#8220;It was quite true what I told the detective. So I
suppose you&#8217;ve finished with me for evermore!&#8221; Audrey
burst out recklessly, as soon as she and Madame Piriac
were alone together. The supreme moment had come, and
she tried to grasp it like a nettle. Her adventurous
rashness was, she admitted, undeniable. She had spoken
the truth to the police officer about her identity and her
spinsterhood because with unusual wisdom she judged that
fibs or even prevarication on such a subject to such an
audience might entangle her in far more serious difficulties
later on. Moreover, with Inspector Keeble present, she
could not successfully have gone very far from the truth.
It was a pity that Madame Piriac had witnessed the scene,
for really, when Audrey came to face it, the deception
which she had practised upon Madame Piriac was of a
monstrous and inexcusable kind. And now that Madame
Piriac knew the facts, many other people would have
to know the facts&mdash;including probably Mr. Gilman. The
prospect of explanations was terrible. In vain Audrey
said to herself that the thing was naught, that she had
acted within her rights, and that anyhow she had long
ago ceased to be diffident and shy!... She was intimidated
by her own enormities. And she also thought: &#8220;How
could I have been silly enough to tell that silly tale about
the Spatts? More complications. And poor dear Inspector
Keeble will be so shocked.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a short pause Madame Piriac replied, in a grave
but kind tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would you that I should have finished with you
for ever? You had the right to call yourself by any name
you wished, and to wear any ring-that pleased your caprice.
It is the affair of nobody but yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m so glad you take it like that,&#8221; said Audrey
with eager relief. &#8220;That&#8217;s just what <em>I</em> thought all along!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it <em>is</em> your affair!&#8221; Madame Piriac finished, with
a peculiar inflection of her well-controlled voice. &#8220;I mean,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;you cannot afford to neglect it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;of course not,&#8221; Audrey agreed, rather dashed, and
with a vague new apprehension. &#8220;Naturally I shall tell you
everything, darling. I had my reasons. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal question is, darling,&#8221; Madame Piriac
stopped her. &#8220;What are you going to do now? Ought we
not to return to the yacht?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must look after Jane Foley!&#8221; cried Audrey. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t leave her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not? She has Miss Ingate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, worse luck for her! Winnie would make the most
dreadful mess of things if she wasn&#8217;t stopped. If Winnie
was right out of it, and Jane Foley had only herself and
Aguilar to count on, there might be a chance. But not else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is by pure hazard that you are here. Nobody expected
you. What would this young girl Mees Foley have
done if you had not been here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good wasting time about that, darling, because
I <em>am</em> here, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; Audrey straightened her
shoulders and put her hands behind her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little one,&#8221; said Madame Piriac with a certain
solemnity. &#8220;You remember our conversation in my boudoir.
I then told you that you would find yourself in a riot within
a month, if you continued your course. Was I right?
Happily you have escaped from that horrible complication.
Go no farther. Listen to me. You were not created for
these adventures. It is impossible that you should be
happy in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look at Jane Foley,&#8221; said Audrey eagerly. &#8220;Is she
not happy? Did you ever see anybody as happy as Jane?
I never did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not happiness,&#8221; replied Madame Piriac. &#8220;That
is exaltation. It is morbid. I do not say that it is not right
for her. I do not say that she is not justified, and that that
which she represents is not justified. But I say that a rôle
such as hers is not your rôle. To commence, she does not
interest herself in men. For her there are no men in the
world&mdash;there are only political enemies. Do you think I
do not know the type? We have it, <em>chez nous</em>. It is full of
admirable qualities&mdash;but it is not your type. For you,
darling, the world is inhabited principally by men, and the
time will come&mdash;perhaps soon&mdash;when for you it will be inhabited
principally by one man. If you remain obdurate,
there must inevitably arrive a quarrel between that man and
these&mdash;these riotous adventures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No man that I could possibly care for,&#8221; Audrey retorted,
&#8220;would ever object to me having an active interest
in&mdash;er&mdash;politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree, darling,&#8221; said Madame Piriac. &#8220;He would
not object. It is you who would object. The quarrel would
occur within your own heart. There are two sorts of women&mdash;individualists
and fanatics. It was always so. I am a
woman, and I know what I&#8217;m saying. So do you. Well,
you belong to the first sort of woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Audrey protested. Nevertheless she recollected
her thoughts on the previous night, near the
binnacle and Mr. Gilman, about the indispensability of a
man and about the futility of the state of not owning and
possessing a man. The memory of these thoughts only
rendered her more obstinate.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not have the courage to tell me that you
are a fanatic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a third sort of woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, believe me, there is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be, anyhow!&#8221; said Audrey with
decision, and in English. &#8220;And I won&#8217;t leave Jane
Foley in the lurch, either!... Now I&#8217;ll just run up
and have a talk with her, if you don&#8217;t mind waiting a
minute or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do?&#8221; Madame Piriac
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;It is obvious that there is only
one safe thing to do. I shall take Jane on board the yacht.
We shall sail off, and she&#8217;ll be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the yacht!&#8221; repeated Madame Piriac, truly
astounded. &#8220;But my poor oncle will never agree. You do
not know him. You do not know how peculiar he is. Never
will he agree! Besides&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; said Audrey quietly and confidently. &#8220;If he
does not agree, I undertake to go into a convent for the rest
of my days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac was silent.</p>

<p>Just as she was opening the door to go upstairs, Audrey
suddenly turned back into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; she said, kissing Madame Piriac. &#8220;How
calmly you&#8217;ve taken it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taken what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About me not being Mrs. Moncreiff nor a widow nor
anything of that kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, darling,&#8221; answered Madame Piriac with exquisite
tranquillity. &#8220;Of course I knew it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew it before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I knew it the first time I saw you, in the
studio of Mademoiselle Nickall. You were the image of
your father! The image, I repeat&mdash;except perhaps the nose.
Recollect that as a child I saw your father. I was left with
my mother&#8217;s relatives, until matters should be arranged;
but he came to Paris. Then before matters could be
arranged my mother died, and I never saw him again. But
I could never forget him.... Then also, in my boudoir that
night, you blushed&mdash;it was very amusing&mdash;when I mentioned
Essex and Audrey Moze. And there were other
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, you were never quite convincing as a widow&mdash;at
any rate to a Frenchwoman. You may have deceived
American and English women. But not myself. You did
not say the convincing things when the conversation took
certain turns. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew who I was, and you never told me!&#8221;
Audrey pouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had I the right, darling? You had decided upon your
identity. It would have been inexcusable on my part to
inform you that you were mistaken in so essential a detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Piriac gently returned Audrey&#8217;s kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that was why you insisted on me coming with you
to-day!&#8221; murmured Audrey, crestfallen. &#8220;You are a
marvellous actress, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have several times been told so,&#8221; Madame Piriac
admitted simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth did you expect would happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that which has happened,&#8221; said Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you ask me,&#8221; said Audrey with gaiety and a
renewal of self-confidence.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s all happened
splendidly.&#8221;</p>

<h3>IN THE DINGHY</h3>


<p>When the pair got back to the sea-wall the tide had considerably
ebbed, and where the dinghy had floated there
was nothing more liquid than exquisitely coloured mud.
Nevertheless water still lapped the yacht, whereas on the
shore side of the yacht was now no crowd. The vans and
carts had all departed, and the quidnuncs and observers of
human nature, having gazed steadily at the yacht for some
ten hours, had thought fit to depart also. The two women
looked about rather anxiously, as though Mr. Gilman had
basely marooned them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what must we do?&#8221; demanded Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! We can walk round on the dyke,&#8221; said Audrey
superiorly. &#8220;Unless the stiles frighten you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is about to rain,&#8221; said Madame Piriac, glancing at
the high curved heels of her shoes.</p>

<p>The sky, which was very wide and variegated over
Mozewater, did indeed seem to threaten.</p>

<p>At that moment the dinghy appeared round the forefoot
of the <em>Ariadne</em>. Mr. Gilman and Miss Thompkins were in
it, and Mr. Gilman was rowing with gentleness and dignity.
They had, even afar off, a tremendous air of intimacy; each
leaned towards the other, face to face, and Tommy had
her chin in her hands and her elbows on her knees. And
in addition to an air of intimacy they had an air of mystery.
It was surprising, and perhaps a little annoying, to Audrey
that those two should have gone on living to themselves, in
their own self-absorbed way, while such singular events had
been happening to herself in Flank Hall. She put several
fingers in her mouth and produced a piercing long-distance
whistle which effectively reached the dinghy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor little one!&#8221; exclaimed Madame Piriac,
shocked in spite of her broadmindedness by both the sound
and the manner of its production.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I learnt that when I was twelve,&#8221; said Audrey.
&#8220;It took me four months, but I did it. And nobody except
Miss Ingate knows that I can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The occupants of the dinghy were signalling their
intention to rescue, and Mr. Gilman used his back nobly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we cannot embark here!&#8221; Madame Piriac complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;You see those white stones? ...
It&#8217;s quite easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the dinghy had done about half the journey
Madame Piriac murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, who are you, precisely, for the present?
It would be prudent to decide, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey hesitated an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I? ... Oh! I see. Well, I&#8217;d better keep
on being Mrs. Moncreiff for a bit, hadn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as you please, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact was that Audrey recoiled from a general confession,
though admitting it to be ultimately inevitable.
Moreover, she had a slight fear that each of her friends in
turn might make a confession ridiculous by saying: &#8220;We
knew all along, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dinghy was close in.</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; cried Tommy. &#8220;Who did that whistle? It was
enough to beat the cars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to know!&#8221; Audrey retorted.</p>

<p>The embarkation, under Audrey&#8217;s direction, was accomplished
in safety, and, save for one tiny French scream, in
silence. The silence, which persisted, was peculiar. Each
pair should have had something to tell the other, yet nothing
was told, or even asked. Mr. Gilman rowed with careful
science, and brought the dinghy alongside the yacht in an
unexceptionable manner. Musa stood on deck apart, acting
indifference. Madame Piriac, having climbed into the
<em>Ariadne</em>, went below at once. Miss Thompkins, seeing her
friend Mr. Price half-way down the saloon companion,
moved to speak to him, and they vanished together. Mr.
Gilman was respectfully informed by the engineer that the
skipper and Dr. Cromarty were ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice it is on the water!&#8221; said Audrey to Mr.
Gilman in a low, gentle voice. &#8220;There is a channel round
there with three feet of water in it at low tide.&#8221; She
sketched a curve in the air with her finger.
&#8220;Of course you know this part,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman
cautiously and even apprehensively. His glance seemed to
be saying: &#8220;And it was you who gave that fearful whistle,
too! Are you, can you be, all that I dreamed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; Audrey answered. &#8220;Would you like me to show
it you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be more than delighted,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>With a gesture he summoned a man to untie the dinghy
again and hold it, and the man slid down into the dinghy
like a monkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull,&#8221; said Audrey, in the boat.</p>

<p>The man sprang out of the dinghy.</p>

<p>&#8220;One instant!&#8221; Mr. Gilman begged her, standing up in
the sternsheets, and popping his head through a porthole
of the saloon. &#8220;Mr. Price!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; From the interior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be good enough to play that air with thirty-six
variations, of Beethoven&#8217;s? We shall hear splendidly
from the dinghy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Audrey said to herself: &#8220;You don&#8217;t want him to
flirt with Tommy while you&#8217;re away, so you&#8217;ve given him
something to keep him busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman remarked under his breath to Audrey:
&#8220;I think there is nothing finer than to hear Beethoven
on the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! There isn&#8217;t!&#8221; she eagerly concurred.</p>

<p>Ignoring the thirty-six variations of Beethoven, Audrey
rowed slowly away, and after about a hundred yards the
boat had rounded a little knoll which marked the beginning
of a narrow channel known as the Lander Creek. The
thirty-six variations, however, would not be denied; they
softly impregnated the whole beautiful watery scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman suddenly, &#8220;perhaps your
ladyship was not quite pleased at me rowing-about with
Miss Thompkins&mdash;especially after I had taken her for a
walk.&#8221; He smiled, but his voice was rather wistful.
Audrey liked him prodigiously in that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foolish man!&#8221; she replied, with a smile far surpassing
his, and she rested on her oars, taking care to keep the
boat in the middle of the channel. &#8220;Do you know why I
asked you to come out? I wanted to talk to you quite
privately. It is easier here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; he said simply and sincerely. And
Audrey thought: &#8220;Is it possible to give so much
pleasure to an important and wealthy man with so little
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of course you know who I really am,
don&#8217;t you, Mr. Gilman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know you&#8217;re Mrs. Moncreiff,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not! Surely you&#8217;ve heard something? Surely
it&#8217;s been hinted in front of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;But haven&#8217;t you asked&mdash;about my marriage, for
instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To ask might have been to endanger your secret,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;How frightfully loyal you
are, Mr. Gilman! I do admire loyalty. Well, I dare say
very, very few people do know. So I&#8217;ll tell you. That&#8217;s
my home over there.&#8221; And she pointed to Flank Hall,
whose chimneys could just be seen over the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit that I had thought so,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>&#8220;But naturally that was your home as a girl, before your
marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been married, Mr. Gilman,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
only what the French call a <em>jeune fille</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face changed; he seemed to be withdrawing alarmed
into himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never&mdash;been married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You <em>must</em> understand me!&#8221; she went on, with
an appealing vivacity. &#8220;I was all alone. I was in mourning
for my father and mother. I wanted to see the world.
I just had to see it! I expect I was very foolish, but it
was so easy to put a ring on my finger and call myself Mrs.
And it gave me such advantages. And Miss Ingate agreed.
She was my mother&#8217;s oldest friend.... You&#8217;re vexed
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always seemed so wise,&#8221; Mr. Gilman faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That&#8217;s only the effect of my forehead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, you know, I always thought there was something
very innocent about you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what <em>that</em> was,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;But
honestly I acted for the best. You see I&#8217;m rather rich.
Supposing I&#8217;d only gone about as a young marriageable
girl&mdash;what frightful risks I should have run, shouldn&#8217;t I?
Somebody would be bound to have married me for my
money. And look at all I should have missed&mdash;without this
ring! I should never have met you in Paris, for instance,
and we should never have had those talks.... And&mdash;and
there&#8217;s a lot more reasons&mdash;I shall tell you another time&mdash;about
Madame Piriac and so on. Now do say you aren&#8217;t
vexed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8221;I think you&#8217;ve been splendid,&#8221; he said, with enthusiasm.
&#8220;I think the girls of to-day <em>are</em> splendid! I&#8217;ve
been a regular old fogey, that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s one thing I want you not to do,&#8221; Audrey
proceeded. &#8220;I want you not to alter the way you talk to
me. Because I&#8217;m really just the same girl I was last night.
And I couldn&#8217;t bear you to change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t! I won&#8217;t! But of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! No buts. I won&#8217;t have it. Do you know
why I told you just this afternoon? Well, partly because
you were so perfectly sweet last night. And partly because
I&#8217;ve got a favour to ask you, and I wouldn&#8217;t ask it until
I&#8217;d told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t ask me a favour,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;because it
wouldn&#8217;t be a favour. It would be my privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you put it like that I can&#8217;t ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must!&#8221; he said firmly.</p>

<p>Then she told him something of the predicament of
Jane Foley. He listened with an expression of trouble.
Audrey finished bluntly: &#8220;She&#8217;s my friend. And I want
you to take her on the yacht to-night after it&#8217;s dark.
Nobody but you can save her. There! I&#8217;ve asked
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Foley!&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>She could see that he was aghast. The syllables of that
name were notorious throughout Britain. They stood for
revolt, damage to property, defiance of law, injured policemen,
forcible feeding, and all sorts of phenomena that
horrified respectable pillars of society.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the dearest thing!&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no
idea. You&#8217;d love her. And she&#8217;s done as much for
Women&#8217;s Suffrage as anybody in the world. She&#8217;s a real
heroine, if you like. You couldn&#8217;t help the cause better
than by helping her. And I know how keen you are to
help.&#8221; And Audrey said to herself: &#8220;He&#8217;s as timid as a
girl about it. How queer men are, after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are we to do with her afterwards?&#8221; asked
Mr. Gilman. There was perspiration on his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sail straight to France, of course. They couldn&#8217;t
touch her there, you see, because it&#8217;s political. It <em>is</em>
political, you know,&#8221; Audrey insisted proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And give up all our cruise?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey bent forward, as she had seen Tommy do. She
smiled enchantingly. &#8220;I quite understand,&#8221; she said, with
a sort of tenderness. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to do it. And it
was a shame of me even to suggest it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do want to do it,&#8221; he protested with splendid
despairful resolve. &#8220;I was only thinking of you&mdash;and the
cruise. I do want to do it. I&#8217;m absolutely at your disposal.
When you ask me to do a thing, I&#8217;m only too
proud. To do it is the greatest happiness I could have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey replied softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You deserve the Victoria Cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever do you mean?&#8221; he demanded nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what I mean,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
you&#8217;re the nicest man I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>He blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say that to me,&#8221; he deprecated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall, and I shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of the thirty-six variations still came very
faintly over the water. The sun sent cataracts of warm
light across all the estuary. The water lapped against the
boat, and Audrey was overwhelmed by the inexplicable
marvel of being alive in the gorgeous universe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to back water,&#8221; she said, low. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no room to turn round here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we&#8217;d better say as little about it as possible,&#8221;
he ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Not a word! Not a word till it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221; He was drenched in an agitating
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Five bells rang clear from the yacht, overmastering the
thirty-six variations.</p>

<p>Audrey thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;d never agree, wouldn&#8217;t he, Madame Piriac!&#8221;</p>




<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_37" id="chapter_37" />CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>


<h3>AFLOAT</h3>


<p>That night, which was an unusually dark night for the time
of year, Audrey left the yacht, alone, to fetch Jane Foley.
She had made a provisional plan with Jane and Aguilar, and
the arrangement with Mr. Gilman had been of the simplest,
necessitating nothing save a brief order from the owner to
the woman whom Audrey could always amuse Mr. Gilman by
calling the &#8220;parlourmaid,&#8221; but who was more commonly
known as the stewardess. This young married creature had
prepared a cabin. For the rest little had been said. The
understanding between Mr. Gilman and Audrey was that
Mrs. Moncreiff should continue to exist, and that not a
word as to the arrival of Jane Foley should escape either of
them until the deed was accomplished. It is true that
Madame Piriac knew of the probable imminence of the
affair, but Madame Piriac was discretion elegantly attired,
and from the moment they had left Flank Hall together she
had been wise enough not even to mention Jane Foley
to Audrey. Madame Piriac appreciated the value of
ignorance in a questionable crisis. Mr. Gilman had been
less guarded. Indeed he had shown a tendency to discuss
the coming adventure with Audrey in remote corners&mdash;a
tendency which had to be discouraged because it gave to
both of them a too obvious air of being tremendous conspirators,
Also Audrey had had to dissuade him from
accompanying her to the Hall. He had rather conventional
ideas about women being abroad alone after dark, and he
abandoned them with difficulty even now.</p>

<p>As there were no street lamps alight in summer in the
village of Moze, Audrey had no fear of being recognised;
moreover, recognition by her former fellow-citizens could
now have no sinister importance; she did not much care
who recognised her. The principal gates of Flank Hall were
slightly ajar, as arranged with Aguilar, and she passed with
a suddenly aroused heart up the drive towards the front
entrance of the house. In spite of herself she could not get
rid of an absurd fear that either Mr. Hurley or Inspector
Keeble or both would jump out of the dark bushes and slip
handcuffs upon her wrists. And the baffling invisibility of
the sky further affected her nerves. There ought to have
been a lamp in the front hall, but no ray showed through
the eighteenth century fanlight over the door. She rang
the bell cautiously. She heard the distant ting. Aguilar,
according to the plan, ought to have opened; but he did not
open; nobody opened. She was instantly sure that she knew
what had happened. Mr. Hurley had been to Frinton and
ascertained that the Spatt story as to the tank-room was
an invention, and had returned with a search warrant and
some tools. But in another ten seconds she was equally sure
that nothing of the sort could have happened, for it was an
axiom with her that Aguilar&#8217;s masterly lying, based on
masterly listening at an attic door, had convinced Mr.
Hurley of the truth of the story about the tank-room.</p>

<p>Accidentally pushing against the front door with an
elbow in the deep obscurity, she discovered that it was not
latched. This was quite contrary to the plan. She stepped
into the house. The unforeseeing simpleton had actually
come on the excursion without a box of matches! She felt
her way, aided by the swift returning memories of childhood,
to the foot of the stairs, and past the stairs into the
kitchen, for in ancient days a candlestick with a box of
matches in it had always been kept on the ledge of the
small square window that gave light to the passage between
the hall and the kitchen. Her father had been most severely
particular about that candlestick (with matches) being-always
ready on that ledge in case of his need. Ridiculous,
of course, to expect a candlestick to be still there! Times
change so. But she felt for it, and there it was, and the
matches too! She lit the candle. The dim scene thus
revealed seemed strange enough to her after the electricity
of the Hôtel du Danube and of the yacht. It made her
want to cry....</p>

<p>She was one of those people who have room in their
minds for all sorts of things at once. And thus she could
simultaneously be worried to an extreme about Jane Foley,
foolish and sad about her immensely distant childhood, and
even regretful that she had admitted the fraudulence of the
wedding-ring on her hand. On the last point she had a
very strong sense of failure and disillusion. When she had
first donned a widow&#8217;s bonnet she had meant to have wondrous
adventures and to hear marvellous conversations as a
widow. And what had she done with her widowhood after
all? Nothing. She could not but think that she ought to
have kept it a little longer, on the chance....</p>

<p>Aguilar made a practice of sleeping in the kitchen; he
considered that a house could only be well guarded at night
from the ground floor. There was his bed, in the corner
against the brush and besom cupboard, all made up. Its
creaselessness, so characteristic of Aguilar, had not been
disturbed. The sight of the narrow bed made Audrey think
what a strange existence was the existence of Aguilar.
... Then, with a boldness that was half bluster, she went
upstairs, and the creaking of the woodwork was affrighting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane! Jane, dear!&#8221; she called out, as she arrived
at the second-storey landing. The sound of her voice was
uncanny in the haunted stillness. All Audrey&#8217;s infancy
floated up the well of the stairs and wrapped itself round
her and tightened her throat. She went along the passage
to the door of the tank-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane, Jane!&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer! The door was locked. She listened. She
put her ear against the door in order to catch the faintest
sound of life within. But she could only hear the crude,
sharp ticking of the cheap clock which, as she knew,
Aguilar had supplied to Jane Foley. The vision of Jane
lying unconscious or dead obsessed her. Then she thrust
it away and laughed at it. Assuredly Aguilar and Jane
must have received some alarm as to a reappearance of
the police; they must have fled while there had yet been
time. Where could they have gone? Of course, through
the garden and plantation and down to the sea-wall,
whence Jane might steal to the yacht. Audrey turned
back towards the stairs, and the vast intimidating emptiness
of the gloomy house, lit by a single flickering candle,
assaulted her. She had to fight it before she could descend.
The garden door was latched, but not locked. Extinguishing
the candle, she went forth. The gusty breeze from the
estuary was now damp on her cheek with the presage
of rain. She hurried, fumbling as it were, through the
garden. When she achieved the hedge the spectacle of
the yacht, gleaming from stem to stern with electricity,
burst upon her; it shone like something desired and unattainable.
Carefully she issued from the grounds by the
little gate and crossed the intervening space to the dyke.
A dark figure moved in front of her, and her heart violently
jumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the cold, imperturbable voice of Aguilar. At
once she felt reassured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Miss Foley?&#8221; she demanded in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got her down here, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Aguilar. &#8220;I
presume as you&#8217;ve been to the house. We had to leave
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the door of the tank-room was locked!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. I locked it a-purpose.... I thought
as it would keep the police employed a bit when they
come. I seen my cousin Sarah when I went to tell Miss
Ingate as you instructed me. My cousin Sarah seen
Keeble. They been to Frinton to Mrs. Spatt&#8217;s, and they
found out about <em>that</em>. And now the &#8217;tec&#8217;s back, or nearly.
I reckon it was the warrant as was delaying him. So I
out with Miss Foley. I thought I could take her across
to the yacht from here. It wouldn&#8217;t hardly be safe for
her to walk round by the dyke. Hurley may have several
of his chaps about by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s not water enough, Aguilar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam. I dragged the old punt down. She
don&#8217;t draw three inches. She&#8217;s afloat now, and Miss
Foley&#8217;s in her. I was just a-going off. If you don&#8217;t mind
wetting your feet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In one minute Audrey had splashed into the punt.
Jane Foley took her hand in silence, and she heard Jane&#8217;s
low, happy laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny?&#8221; Jane whispered.</p>

<p>Audrey squeezed her hand.</p>

<p>Aguilar pushed off with an oar, and he continued to
use the oar as a punt-pole, so that no sound of their
movement should reach the bank. Water was pouring into
the old sieve, and they touched ground once. But Aguilar
knew precisely what he was about and got her off again.
They approached the yacht with the slow, sure inexorability
of Aguilar&#8217;s character. A beam from the portholes of
the saloon caught Aguilar&#8217;s erect figure. He sat down,
poling as well as he could from the new position. When
they were a little nearer he stopped dead, holding the
punt firm by means of the pole fixed in the mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s there afore us!&#8221; he murmured, pointing.</p>

<p>Under the Maltese cross of electric lights at the inner
end of the gangway could clearly be seen the form of
Mr. Hurley, engaged in conversation with Mr. Gilman.
Mr. Hurley was fairly on board.</p>

<h3>IN THE UNIVERSE</h3>

<p>When Audrey, having been put ashore in execution of
a plan arranged with those naturally endowed strategists,
Aguilar and Jane Foley, arrived at the Hard by way of
the sea-wall, Mr. Hurley was still in parley with Mr.
Gilman under the Maltese cross of electric lights. From
the distance Mr. Gilman had an air of being somewhat
intimidated by the Irishman, but as soon as he distinguished
the figure of Audrey at the shore end of the
gangway his muscles became mysteriously taut, and his
voice charged with defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already told you, sir,&#8221; Audrey heard him say,
&#8220;there is no such person aboard the yacht. And I most
certainly will not allow you to search. You have no right
whatever to search, and you know it. You have my word.
My name is Gilman. You may have heard of me. I&#8217;m
chairman of the Board of Foodstuffs, Limited. Gilman, sir.
And I shall feel obliged if you will leave my decks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sailing to-night?&#8221; asked Mr. Hurley placidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil has that got to do with you, sir?&#8221;
replied Mr. Gilman gloriously.</p>

<p>Audrey, standing behind the detective and unseen by
him, observed the gloriousness of Mr. Gilman&#8217;s demeanour
and also Mr. Gilman&#8217;s desire that she should note the
same and appreciate it. She nodded violently several times
to Mr. Gilman, to urge him to answer the detective in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es, sir. Since you are so confoundedly inquisitive,
I am sailing to-night. I shall sail as soon as the tide
serves,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman hurriedly and fiercely, and then
glanced again at Audrey for further approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where for?&#8221; Mr. Hurley demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where I please, sir,&#8221; Mr. Gilman snorted. By this
time he evidently imagined that he was furious, and was
taking pleasure in his fury.</p>

<p>Mr. Hurley, having given a little ironic bow, turned
to leave and found himself fronting Audrey, who stiffly
ignored his salute. The detective gone, Mr. Gilman walked
to and fro, breathing more loudly than ever, and unsuccessfully
pretending to a scattered audience, which consisted
of the skipper, Mr. Price, Dr. Cromarty, and sundry deck-hands,
that he had done nothing in particular and was
not a hero. As Audrey approached him he seemed to lay
all his glory with humble pride at her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he brought that on himself!&#8221; said Audrey,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; Mr. Gilman concurred, gazing at the Hard
with inimical scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t come&mdash;now,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
be safe. He means to stay on the Hard till we&#8217;re gone.
He&#8217;s a very suspicious man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hurley was indeed lingering just beyond the immediate
range of the <em>Ariadne&#8217;s</em> lamps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t come! What a pity! What a pity!&#8221; murmured
Mr. Gilman, with an accent that was not a bit
sincere. The news was the best he had heard for hours.
&#8220;But I suppose,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we&#8217;d better sail just the
same, as I&#8217;ve said we should?&#8221; He did not want to run
the risk of getting Jane Foley after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Do!&#8221; Audrey exclaimed. &#8220;It will be lovely! If it
doesn&#8217;t rain&mdash;and even if it does rain! We all like sailing at
night.... Are the others in the saloon? I&#8217;ll run down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wyatt,&#8221; the owner sternly accosted the captain.
&#8220;When can we get off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! About midnight,&#8221; Audrey answered quickly,
before Mr. Wyatt could compose his lips.</p>

<p>The men gazed at each other surprised by this show of
technical knowledge in a young widow. By the time Mr.
Wyatt had replied, Audrey was descending into the saloon.
It was Aguilar who, having ascertained the <em>Ariadne&#8217;s</em>
draught, had made the calculation as to the earliest possible
hour of departure.</p>

<p>And in the saloon Musa was, as it were, being enveloped
and kept comfortable in the admiring sympathy of Madame
Piriac and Miss Thompkins. Mr. Gilman&#8217;s violin lay
across his knees&mdash;perhaps he had been tuning it&mdash;and the
women inclined towards him, one on either side. It was
a sight that somewhat annoyed Audrey, who told herself
that she considered it silly. Admitting that Musa had
genius, she could not understand this soft flattery of
genius. She never flattered genius herself, and she did
not approve of others doing so. Certainly Musa was now
being treated on the yacht as a celebrity of the first
order, and Audrey could find no explanation of the steady
growth in the height and splendour of his throne.
Her arrival dissolved the spectacle. Within one minute,
somehow, the saloon was empty and everybody on deck
again.</p>

<p>And then, drawing her away, Musa murmured to Audrey
in a disconcerting tone that he must speak to her on a
matter of urgency, and that in order that he might do
so, they must go ashore and walk seawards, far from
interruption. She consented, for she was determined to
prove to him at close quarters that she was a different
creature from the other two. They moved to the gangway
amid discreet manifestations from the doctor and the
secretary&mdash;manifestations directed chiefly to Musa and
indicative of his importance as a notability. Audrey was
puzzled. For her, Musa was more than ever just Musa,
and less than ever a personage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not return to the yacht,&#8221; he said, with an
excited bitterness, after they had walked some distance
along one of the paths leading past low bushes into the
wilderness of the marsh land that bounded the estuary
to the south. The sky was still invisible, but there was
now a certain amount of diffused light, and the pale path
could easily be distinguished amid the sombreness of
green. The yacht was hidden behind one of the knolls.
No sound could be heard. The breeze had died. That
which was around them&mdash;on either hand, above, below&mdash;was
the universe. They knew that they stood still in the
universe, and this idea gave their youth the sensation of
being very important.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that which you say?&#8221; Audrey demanded
sharply in French, as Musa had begun in French. She
was aware, not for the first time with Musa, of the
sudden possibilities of drama in a human being. She
could scarcely make out his face, but she knew that he
was in a mood for high follies; she knew that danger was
gathering; she knew that the shape of the future was
immediately to be moulded by her and him, and chiefly
by herself. She liked it. The sensation of her importance
was reinforced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say I shall never return to the yacht,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>She thought compassionately:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor foolish thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was incalculably older and wiser than this irrational
boy. She was the essence of wisdom.</p>

<p>She said, with acid detachment:</p>

<p>&#8220;But your luggage, your belongings? What an idea to
leave in this manner! It is so polite, so sensible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I do not at all understand
why you are going. But what does that matter? You
are going.&#8221; Her indifference was superb. It was so
superb that it might have driven some men to destroy
her on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you understand! I told you last night,&#8221; said
Musa, overflowing with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You told me? I forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally Monsieur Gilman is rich. I am not rich,
though I shall be. But you can&#8217;t wait,&#8221; Musa sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what you mean,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Musa. &#8220;Once I told you that Tommy
and Nick lent me the money with which to live. For me,
since then, you have never been the same being. How
stupid I was to tell you! You could not comprehend
such a thing. Your soul is too low to comprehend it.
Permit me to say that I have already repaid Nick. And
at the first moment I shall repay Tommy. My position
is secure. I have only to wait. But you will not wait.
You are a bourgeoise of the most terrible sort. Opulence
fascinates you. Mr. Gilman has opulence. He has nothing
else. But he has opulence, and for you that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant her indifference, self-control, wisdom
vanished. It was a sad exhibition of frailty; but she
enjoyed it, she revelled in it, giving play to everything
in herself that was barbaric. The marsh around them
was probably as it had been before the vikings had sailed
into it, and Audrey rushed back with inconceivable speed
into the past and became the primeval woman of twenty
centuries earlier. Like almost all women she possessed
this wondrous and affrighting faculty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are telling a wicked untruth!&#8221; she exploded in
English. &#8220;And what&#8217;s more, you know you are. You
disgust me. You know as well as I do I don&#8217;t care anything
for money&mdash;anything. Only you&#8217;re a horrid, spoilt
beast. You think you can upset me, but you can&#8217;t. I
won&#8217;t have it, either from you or from anybody else. It&#8217;s
a shame, that&#8217;s what it is. Now you&#8217;ve got to apologise
to me. I absolutely insist on it. You aren&#8217;t going to
bully me, even if you think you are. I&#8217;ll soon show you
the sort of girl I am, and you make no mistake! Are
you going to apologise or aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The indecorous creature was breathing as loudly as Mr.
Gilman himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit it,&#8221; said Musa yielding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand your pardon. I knew that what I said was
not true. I am outside myself. But what would you? It
is stronger than I. This existence is terrible, on the yacht.
I cannot support it. I shall become mad. I am ruined.
My jealousy is intolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; said Audrey, using French again, more calmly,
having returned to the twentieth century.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is intolerable to me.&#8221; Then Musa&#8217;s voice changed
and grew persuasive, rather like a child&#8217;s. &#8220;I cannot live
without you. That is the truth. I am an artist, and you
are necessary to me and to my career.&#8221; He lifted his head.
&#8220;And I can offer you everything that is most brilliant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about my career?&#8221; Audrey questioned
inimically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your career?&#8221; He seemed at a loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. My career. It has possibly not occurred to you
that I also may have a career.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa became appealing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told you you do not
comprehend, but you comprehend everything. It is that
which enrages me. You have had experience. You know
what men are. You could teach me so much. I hate young
girls. I have always hated them. They are so tasteless, so
insufferably innocent. I could not talk to a young girl as I
talk to you. It would be absurd. Now as to my career&mdash;what
I said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa,&#8221; she interrupted him, with a sinister quietude,
&#8220;I want to tell you something. But you must promise to
keep it secret. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He assented, impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not possible!&#8221; he exclaimed, when she had told
him that she belonged to precisely the category of human
beings whom he hated and despised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said she. &#8220;Now I hope you see how little
you know, really, about women.&#8221; She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not possible!&#8221; he repeated. And then he said
with deliberate ingenuousness: &#8220;I am so content. I am so
happy. I could not have hoped for it. It is overwhelming.
I am everything you like of the most idiotic, blind, stupid.
But now I am happy. Could I ever have borne that you
had loved before I knew you? I doubt if I could have borne
it. Your innocence is exquisite. It is intoxicating to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa,&#8221; she remarked dryly; &#8220;I wish you would remember
that you are in England. People do not talk in that
way in England. It simply is not done. And I will not
listen to it.&#8221; Her voice grew a little tender. &#8220;Why can
we not just be friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is folly,&#8221; said he, with sudden disgust. &#8220;And it
would kill me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she replied, receding. &#8220;You&#8217;re entitled
to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>He advanced towards her. She kept him away with a
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to marry you?&#8221; she questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is essential,&#8221; he said, very seriously. &#8220;I adore you.
I can&#8217;t do anything because of you. I can&#8217;t think of anything
but you. You are more marvellous than anyone can
be. You cannot appreciate what you are to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose you are nothing to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is necessary that you should love me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? I see no necessity. You want me&mdash;because you
want me. That&#8217;s all. I can&#8217;t help it if you&#8217;re mad. Your
attitude is insulting. You have not given one thought to
my feelings. And if I said &#8216;yes&#8217; to you, you&#8217;d marry
me whatever my feelings were. You think only of yourself.
It is the old attitude. And when I offer you my friendship,
you instantly decline it. That shows how horribly French
you are. Frenchmen can&#8217;t understand the idea of friendship
between a man and a girl. They sneer at it. It shows
what brutes you all are. Why should I marry you? I
should have nothing to gain by it. You&#8217;ll be famous. Well,
what do I care? Do you think it would be very amusing
for me to be the wife of a famous man that was run after
by every silly creature in Paris or London or New York?
Not quite! And I don&#8217;t see myself. You don&#8217;t like young
girls. I don&#8217;t like young men. They&#8217;re rude and selfish
and conceited. They&#8217;re like babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; Musa broke in, &#8220;you are in love with
the old Gilman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not old!&#8221; cried Audrey. &#8220;In some ways he is
much less worn out than you are. And supposing I am in
love with Mr. Gilman? Does it regard you? Do not be
rude. Mr. Gilman is at any rate polite. He is not capricious.
He is reliable. You aren&#8217;t reliable. You want someone
upon whom you can rely. How nice for your wife! You
play the violin. True. You are a genius. But you cannot
always be on the platform. And when you are not on the
platform...! Heavens! If I wish to hear you play I
can buy a seat and come and hear you and go away again.
But your wife, responsible for your career&mdash;she will never
be free. Her life will be unbearable. What anxiety!
Misery, I should say rather! You would have the lion&#8217;s
share of everything. Now for myself I intend to have the
lion&#8217;s share. And why shouldn&#8217;t I? Isn&#8217;t it about time
some woman had it? You can&#8217;t have the lion&#8217;s share if you
are not free. I mean to be free. If I marry I shall want
a husband that is not a prison.... Thank goodness I&#8217;ve
got money.... Without that&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Musa, &#8220;you have no feeling for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love?&#8221; she laughed exasperatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that much!&#8221; She snapped her fingers. &#8220;But"&mdash;in
a changed tone&mdash;"I <em>should</em> like to like you. I shall be
very disgusted if your concerts are not a tremendous success.
And they will not be if you don&#8217;t keep control over yourself
and practise properly. And it will be your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, good-bye!&#8221; he said, coldly ignoring all her
maternal suggestions. And turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going to?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know. But if I do not deceive myself I have
already informed you that in certain circumstances I should
not return to the yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are worse than a schoolboy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, <em>I</em> shan&#8217;t explain on the yacht. I shall tell
them that I know nothing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But no one will believe you,&#8221; he retorted maliciously
over his shoulder. And then he was gone.</p>

<p>She at any rate was no longer surrounded by the largeness
of the universe. He might still be, but she was not.
She was in mind already on the yacht trying to act a
surprise equal to the surprise of the others when Musa
failed to reappear. She was very angry with him, not
because he had been a rude schoolboy and was entirely impossible
as a human being, but because she had allowed
herself to leave the yacht with him and would therefore be
compelled sooner or later to answer questions about him.
She seriously feared that Mr. Gilman might refuse to sail
unless she confessed to him her positive knowledge that
Musa would not be seen again, and that thus she might
have to choose between the failure of her plans for Jane
Foley and her own personal discomfiture.</p>

<p>Instead of being in the mighty universe she was
struggling amid the tiresome littleness of society on a yacht.
She hated yachts for their very cosiness and their quality
of keeping people close together who wanted to be far
apart. And as she watched the figure of Musa growing
fainter she was more than ever impressed by the queerness of
men. Women seemed to be so logical, so realistic, so
understandable, so calculable, whereas men were enigmas
of waywardness and unreason. At just that moment her
feet reminded her that they had been wetted by the adventure
in the punt, and she said to herself sagely that she
must take precautions against a chill.</p>

<p>And then she thought she detected some unusual phenomenon
behind a clump of bushes to the right which hid a
plank-bridge across a waterway. She would have been
frightened if she had not been very excited. And in her
excitement she marched straight up to the clump, and
found Mr. Hurley in a crouching posture. She started, and
recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have known!&#8221; she said disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all make mistakes,&#8221; said Mr. Hurley defensively.
&#8220;We all make mistakes. I knew I&#8217;d made a mistake as
soon as I got here, but I couldn&#8217;t get away quietly enough.
And you talked so loud. Ye&#8217;ll admit I had just cause for
suspicion. And being a very agreeable lady ye&#8217;ll pardon
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed, and then ceased blushing because it was
too dark for him to perceive the blush, and she passed on
without a word. When, across the waste, she had come
within sight of the yacht again, she heard footsteps behind
her, and turned to withstand the detective. But the
overtaker was Musa.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is necessary that I should return to the yacht,&#8221; he
said savagely. &#8220;The thought of you and Monsieur Gilman
together, without me.... No! I did not know myself.
 ... I did not know myself.... It is impossible for me
to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer. They boarded the yacht as though
they had been for a stroll. Few could have guessed that
they had come back from the universe terribly scathed.
Accepting deferential greetings as a right, Musa vanished
rapidly to his cabin.</p>

<p>Several hours later Audrey and Mr. Gilman, alone among
the passengers, were standing together, both tarpaulined,
on the starboard bow, gazing seaward as the yacht cautiously
felt her way down Mozewater. Captain Wyatt, and not
Mr. Gilman, was at the binnacle. A little rain was falling
and the night was rather thick but not impenetrable.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the light!&#8221; said Audrey excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sharp eyes you have!&#8221; said Mr. Gilman. &#8220;I
can see it, too.&#8221; He spoke a word to the skipper, and
the skipper spoke, and then the engine went still more
slowly.</p>

<p>The yacht approached the Flank buoy dead slow,
scarcely stemming the tide. The Moze punt was tied up
to the buoy, and Aguilar held a lantern on a boathook,
while Jane Foley, very wet, was doing a spell of baling.
Aguilar dropped the boathook and, casting off, brought
the punt alongside the yacht. The steps were lowered and
Jane Foley, with laughing, rain-sprinkled face, climbed up.
Aguilar handed her bag which contained nearly everything
she possessed on earth. She and Audrey kissed calmly, and
Audrey presented Mr. Gilman to a suddenly shy Jane. In
the punt Miss Foley had been seen to take an affectionate
leave of Aguilar. She now leaned over the rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; she said, with warmth. &#8220;Thanks ever so
much. It&#8217;s been splendid. I do hope you won&#8217;t be too
wet. Can you row all the way home?&#8221; She shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go back on the tide, Miss Foley,&#8221; answered
Aguilar.</p>

<p>He touched his cap to Audrey, mumbled gloomily a
salutation, and loosed his hold on the yacht; and at once the
punt felt the tide and began to glide away in the darkness
towards Moze. The yacht&#8217;s engine quickened. Flank
buoy faded.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman and the two girls made a group.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wonderful! You really are!&#8221; said Mr. Gilman,
addressing apparently the pair of them. He was enthusiastic.
... He added with grandeur, &#8220;And now for
France!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope Mr. Hurley is still hanging about Moze,&#8221;
said Audrey. &#8220;Mr. Gilman, shall I show Miss Foley her
cabin? She&#8217;s rather wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do! Oh, do, please! But don&#8217;t forget that we
are to have supper together. I insist on supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Audrey thought: &#8220;How agreeable he is! How
kind-hearted! He hasn&#8217;t got any &#8216;career&#8217; to worry about,
and I adore him, and he&#8217;s as simple as knitting.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE IMMINENT DRIVE</h3>


<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Miss Thompkins. &#8220;You can see it from
here. It&#8217;s funny how unreal it seems, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed at one of the large white-curtained windows
of the restaurant, through which was visible a round
column covered with advertisements of theatres, music-halls,
and concert-halls, printed in many colours and announcing
superlative delights. Names famous wherever
pleasure is understood gave to their variegated posters a
pleasant air of distinguished familiarity&mdash;names of theatres
such as &#8220;Variétés,&#8221; &#8220;Vaudeville,&#8221; &#8220;Châtelet,&#8221; &#8220;Théâtre
Français,&#8221; &#8220;Folies-Bergère,&#8221; and names of persons such as
&#8220;Sarah Bernhardt,&#8221; &#8220;Huegenet,&#8221; &#8220;Le Bargy,&#8221; &#8220;Litvinne,&#8221;
&#8220;Lavallière.&#8221; But the name in the largest type&mdash;dark
crimson letters on rose paper&mdash;the name dominating all the
rest, was the name of Musa. The ingenuous stranger to
Paris was compelled to think that as an artist Musa was
far more important than anybody else. Along the length of
all the principal boulevards, and in many of the lesser
streets, the ingenuous stranger encountered, at regular distances
of a couple of hundred yards or so, one of these
columns planted on the kerb; and all the scores of them
bore exactly the same legend; they all spoke of nothing but
blissful diversions, and they all put Musa ahead of anybody
else in the world of the stage and the platform. Sarah
Bernhardt herself, dark blue upon pale, was a trifle compared
to Musa on the columns. And it had been so for
days. Other posters were changed daily&mdash;changed by
mysterious hands before even bread-girls were afoot with
their yards of bread&mdash;but the space given to Musa repeated
always the same tidings, namely that Musa ("the great
violinist") was to give an orchestral concert at the Salle
Xavier, assisted by the Xavier orchestra, on Thursday,
September 24, at 9 P.M. Particulars of the programme
followed.</p>

<p>Paris was being familiarised with Musa. His four
letters looked down upon the fever of the thoroughfares;
they were perused by tens of thousands of sitters in cafés
and in front of cafés; they caught the eye of men and
women fleeing from the wrath to come in taxicabs; they
competed successfully with newspaper placards; and on that
Thursday&mdash;for the Thursday in question had already run
more than half its course&mdash;they had so entered into the
sub-conscious brain of Paris that no habitué of the streets,
whatever his ignorant indifference to the art of music,
could have failed to reply with knowledge, on hearing Musa
mentioned, &#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; implying that he was fully acquainted
with the existence of the said Musa.</p>

<p>Tommy was right: there did seem to be a certain unreality
about the thing, yet it was utterly real.</p>

<p>All the women turned to glance at the name through the
window, and some of them murmured sympathetic and interested
exclamations and bright hopes. There were five
women: Miss Thompkins, Miss Nickall, Madame Piriac,
Miss Ingate and Audrey. And there was one man&mdash;Mr.
Gilman. And the six were seated at a round table in the
historic Parisian restaurant. Mr. Gilman had the air
triumphant, and he was entitled to it. The supreme moment
of his triumph had come. Having given a luncheon to these
ladies, he had just asked, with due high negligence, for the
bill. If there was one matter in which Mr. Gilman was a
truly great expert, it was the matter of giving a meal in a
restaurant. He knew how to dress for such an affair&mdash;with
strict conventionality but a touch of devil-may-care youthfulness
in the necktie. He knew how to choose the
restaurant; he had about half a dozen in his répertoire&mdash;all
of the first order and for the most part combining the
exclusive with the amusing&mdash;entirely different in kind from
the pandemonium where Audrey had eaten on the night of
her first arrival in Paris; he knew how to get the best out
of head-waiters and waiters, who in these restaurants were
not head-waiters and waiters but worldly priests and
acolytes; his profound knowledge of cookery sprang from
a genuine interest in his stomach, and he could compose a
menu in a fashion to command the respect of head-waiters
and to excite the envy of musicians composing a sonata; he
had the wit to look in early and see to the flowers; above all
he was aware what women liked in the way of wine, and
since this was never what he liked in the way of wine, he
would always command a half-bottle of the extra dry for
himself, but would have it manipulated with such discretion
that not a guest could notice it. He paid lavishly and
willingly, convinced by hard experience that the best is
inestimable, but he felt too that the best was really quite
cheap, for he knew that there were imperfectly educated
people in the world who thought nothing of paying the price
of a good meal for a mere engraving or a bit of china.
Withal, he never expected his guests truly to appreciate the
marvels he offered them. They could not, or very rarely.
Their twittering ecstatic praise, which was without understanding,
sufficed for him, though sometimes he would give
gentle diffident instruction. This trait in him was very
attractive, proving the genuineness of his modesty.</p>

<p>The luncheon was partly to celebrate the return of various
persons to Paris, but chiefly in honour of Musa&#8217;s concert.
Musa could not be present, for distinguished public performers
do not show themselves on the day of an appearance.
Mr. Gilman had learnt this from Madame Piriac, whom he
had consulted as to the list of guests. It is to be said that
he bore the absence of Musa from his table with stoicism.
For the rest, Madame Piriac knew that he wanted no other
men, and she had suggested none. She had assumed that
he desired Audrey, and had pointed out that Audrey could
not well be invited without Miss Ingate, who, sick of her
old Moze, had rejoined Audrey in the splendour of the Hôtel
du Danube. Mr. Gilman had somehow mentioned Miss
Thompkins, whereupon Madame Piriac had declared that
Miss Thompkins involved Miss Nickall, who after a complete
recovery from the broken arm had returned for a while to
her studio. And then Mr. Gilman had closed the list, saying
that six was enough, and exactly the right number.</p>

<p>&#8220;At what o&#8217;clock are you going for the drive?&#8221; asked
Madame Piriac in her improved, precise English. She
looked equally at her self-styled uncle and at Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ordered the car for three o&#8217;clock,&#8221; answered Mr.
Gilman. &#8220;It is not yet quite three.&#8221;</p>

<p>The table with its litter of ash-trays, empty cups, empty
small glasses, and ravaged sweets, and the half-deserted
restaurant, and the polite expectant weariness of the priests
and acolytes, all showed that the hour was in fact not quite
three&mdash;an hour at which such interiors have invariably the
aspect of roses overblown and about to tumble to pieces.</p>

<p>And immediately upon the reference to the drive everybody
at the table displayed a little constraint, avoiding the
gaze of everybody else, thus demonstrating that the imminent
drive was a delicate, without being a disagreeable, topic.
Which requires explanation.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman had not been seen by any of his guests
during the summer. He had landed them at Boulogne from
the <em>Ariadne</em>&mdash;sound but for one casualty. That casualty
was Jane Foley, suffering from pneumonia, which had presumably
developed during the evening of exposure spent
with Aguilar in the leaking punt and in rain showers.
Madame Piriac and Audrey took her to Wimereux and there
nursed her through a long and sometimes dangerous illness.
Jane possessed no constitution, but she had obstinacy, which
saved her. In her convalescence, part of which she spent
alone with Audrey (Madame Piriac having to pay visits to
Monsieur Piriac), she had proceeded with the writing of a
book, and she had also received in conclave the rarely seen
Rosamund, who like herself was still a fugitive from British
justice. These two had been elaborating a new plan of
campaign, which was to include an incursion by themselves
into England, and which had in part been confided by Jane
to Audrey, who, having other notions in her head, had been
somewhat troubled thereby. Audrey&#8217;s conscience had
occasionally told her to throw herself heartily into the campaign,
but her individualistic instincts had in the end kept
her safely on a fence between the campaign and something
else. The something else was connected with Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman had written to her regularly; he had sent
dazzling subscriptions to the Suffragette Union; and
Audrey had replied regularly. His letters were very simple,
very modest, and quite touching. They were dated from
various coastal places. However, he never came near
Wimereux, though it was a coastal place. Audrey had
excusably deemed this odd; but Madame Piriac having once
said with marked casualness, &#8220;I hinted to him that he might
with advantage stay away,&#8221; Audrey had concealed her
thoughts on the point. And one of her thoughts was that
Madame Piriac was keeping them apart so as to try them,
so as to test their mutual feelings. The policy, if it was
a policy, was very like Madame Piriac; it had the effect
of investing Mr. Gilman in Audrey&#8217;s mind with a peculiar
romantic and wistful charm, as of a sighing and obedient
victim. Then Jane Foley and Rosamund had gone off somewhere,
and Madame Piriac and Audrey had returned to
Paris, and had found that practically all Paris had returned
to Paris too. And on the first meeting with Mr. Gilman it
had been at once established that his feelings and those of
Audrey had surmounted the Piriac test. Within forty-eight
hours all persons interested had mysteriously assumed
that Mr. Gilman and Audrey were coupled together by fate
and that a delicious crisis was about to supervene in their
earthly progress. And they had become objects of exquisite
solicitude. They had also become perfect. A circle of
friends and acquaintances waited in excited silence for a
palpitating event, as a populace waits for the booming gunfire
which is to inaugurate a national rejoicing. And when
the news exuded that he was taking her for a drive to
Meudon, which she had never seen, alone, all decided beyond
any doubt that <em>he would do it during the drive</em>.</p>

<p>Hence the nice constraint at the table when the drive
grew publicly and avowedly imminent.</p>

<p>Audrey, as the phrase is, &#8220;felt her position keenly,&#8221; but
not unpleasantly, nor with understanding. Not a word had
passed of late between herself and Mr. Gilman that any
acquaintance might not have listened to. Indeed, Mr.
Gilman had become slightly more formal. She liked him
for that, as she liked him for a large number of qualities.
She did not know whether she loved him. And strange to
say, the question did not passionately interest her. The
only really interesting questions were: Would he propose
to her? And would she accept him? She had no logical
ground for assuming that he would propose to her. None
of her friends had informed her of the general expectation
that he would propose to her. Yet she knew that everybody
expected him to propose to her quite soon&mdash;indeed within
the next couple of hours. And she felt that everybody was
right. The universe was full of mysteries for Audrey. As
regards her answer to any proposal, she foresaw&mdash;another
mystery&mdash;that it would not depend upon self-examination or
upon reason, or upon anything that could be defined. It
would depend upon an instinct over which her mind&mdash;nay,
even her heart&mdash;had no control. She was quite certainly
aware that this instinct would instruct her brain to instruct
her lips to say &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The idea of saying &#8220;No&#8221; simply
could not be conceived. All the forces in the universe would
combine to prevent her from saying &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>The one thing that might have countered that enigmatic
and powerful instinct was a consideration based upon the
difference between her age and that of Mr. Gilman. It is
true that she did not know what the difference was, because
she did not know Mr. Gilman&#8217;s age. And she could not ask
him. No! Such is the structure of society that she could
not say to Mr. Gilman, &#8220;By the way, Mr. Gilman, how old
are you?&#8221; She could properly ascertain his tastes about
all manner of fundamental points, such as the shape of chair-legs,
the correct hour for dining, or the comparative merits
of diamonds and emeralds; but this trifle of information
about his age could not be asked for. And he did not make
her a present of it. She might have questioned Madame
Piriac, but she could not persuade herself to question Madame
Piriac either. However, what did it matter? Even if she
learnt his age to a day, he would still be precisely the same
Mr. Gilman. And let him be as old or as young as he might,
she was still his equal in age. She was far more than six
months older than she had been six months ago.</p>

<p>The influence of Madame Piriac through the summer had
indirectly matured her. For above all Madame Piriac had
imperceptibly taught her the everlasting joy and duty of
exciting the sympathy, admiration and gratitude of the other
sex. Hence Audrey had aged at a miraculous rate because
in order to please Mr. Gilman she wished&mdash;possibly without
knowing it&mdash;to undo the disparity between herself and him.
This may be strange, but it is assuredly more true than
strange. To the same ends she had concealed her own age.
Nobody except Miss Ingate knew how old she was. She
only made it clear, when doubts seemed to exist, that she
had passed her majority long before. Further, her wealth,
magnified by legend, assisted her age. Not that she was so
impressed by her wealth as she had been. She had met
American women in Paris compared to whom she was at
destitution&#8217;s door. She knew one woman who had kept a
2,000-ton yacht lying all summer in the outer harbour at
Boulogne, and had used it during that period for exactly
eleven hours.</p>

<p>Few of these people had an establishment. They would
rent floors in hotels, or châteaux in Touraine, or yachts, but
they had no home, and yet they seemed very content and
beyond doubt they were very free. And so Audrey did not
trouble about having a home. She had Moze, which was
more than many of her acquaintances had. She would not
use it, but she had it. And she was content in the knowledge
of the power to create a home when she felt inclined
to create one. Not that it would not have been absurd to set
about creating a home with Mr. Gilman hanging over her
like a destiny. It would have been rude to him to do so;
it would have been to transgress against the inter-sexual
code as promulgated by Madame Piriac.... She wondered
what sort of a place Meudon was, and whether he
would propose to her while they were looking at the view
together.... She trembled with the sense of adventure,
which had little to do with happiness or unhappiness....
But <em>would</em> he propose to her? Not improbably the whole
conception of the situation was false and she was being
ridiculous!</p>

<p>Still the nice constraint persisted as the women began
to put on their gloves, while Mr. Gilman had a word with
the chief priest. And Audrey had the illusion of being a
dedicated victim. As she self-consciously and yet proudly
handled her gloves she could not help but notice the simple
gold wedding-ring on a certain finger. She had never
removed it. She had never formally renounced her claim
to the status of a widow. That she was not a widow, that
she had been guilty of a fraud on a gullible public, was
somehow generally known; but the facts were not referred
to, save perhaps in rare hints by Tommy, and she had continued
to be known as Mrs. Moncreiff. Ignominious close
to a daring enterprise! And in the circumstances nothing
was more out of place than the ring, bought in cold, wilful,
calculating naughtiness at Colchester.</p>

<p>Just when Miss Ingate was beginning to discuss her own
plans for the afternoon, Mr. Price entered the restaurant,
and as he did so Miss Thompkins, saying something about
the small type on the poster outside, went to the window to
examine it. Mr. Price, disguised as a discreet dandy-about-town,
bore a parcel of music. He removed a most glossy
hat; he bowed to the whole company of ladies, who
responded with smiles in which was acknowledge that
he was a dandy in addition to being a secretary; and
lastly with deference he handed the parcel of music to
Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did get it! What did I tell you?&#8221; said Mr.
Gilman with negligent condescension. &#8220;A minute later,
and we should have been gone.... Has Mr. Price got this
right?&#8221; he asked Audrey, putting the music respectfully in
front of her.</p>

<p>It included the reduced score of the Beethoven violin
concerto, and other items to be performed that night at the
Salle Xavier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Thank you, Mr. Price!&#8221; said Audrey. The
music was so fresh and glossy and luscious to the eye that
it was like a gift of fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, then, Price,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget
about those things for to-night, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I have a note of all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Price bowed and turned away, assuming his perfect
hat. As he approached the door Tommy intercepted him;
and said something to him in a low voice, to which he uncomfortably
mumbled a reply. As they had admittedly been
friends in Mr. Price&#8217;s artistic days, exception could not be
taken to this colloquy. Nevertheless Audrey, being as
suspicious as a real widow, regarded it ill, thinking all
manner of things. And when Tommy, humming, came
back to her seat on Mr. Gilman&#8217;s left hand, Audrey
thought: &#8220;And why, after all, should she be on his left
hand? It is of course proper that I should be on his right,
but why should Tommy be on his left? Why not Madame
Piriac or Miss Ingate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what am <em>I</em> going to do this afternoon?&#8221; demanded
Miss Ingate, lengthening the space between her nose and her
upper lip, and turning down the corners of her lower lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to try that new dress on, Winnie,&#8221; said
Audrey rather reprovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone? Me go alone there? I wouldn&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s
not respectable the way they look at you and add you up
and question you in those trying-on rooms, when they&#8217;ve
<em>got</em> you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, take Elise with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me take Elise? I won&#8217;t do it, not unless I could keep
her mouth full of pins all the time. Whenever we&#8217;re alone,
and her mouth isn&#8217;t full of pins, she always talks to me as
if I was an actress. And I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Miss Nickall kindly, &#8220;come with me
and Tommy. We haven&#8217;t anything to do, and I&#8217;m taking
Tommy to see Jane Foley. Jane would love to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might,&#8221; replied Miss Ingate. &#8220;Oh! She might.
But I think I&#8217;ll walk across to the hotel and just go to bed
and sleep it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep what off?&#8221; asked Tommy, with necklace rattling
and orchidaceous eyes glittering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Everything! Everything!&#8221; shrieked Miss
Ingate.</p>

<p>There was one other customer left in the restaurant, a
solitary fair, fat man, and as Mr. Gilman&#8217;s party was leaving,
Audrey last, this solitary fair, fat man caught her eye,
bowed, and rose. It was Mr. Cowl, secretary of the
National Reformation Society. He greeted her with the
assurance of an old and valued friend, and he called her
neither Miss nor Mrs.; he called her nothing at all. Audrey
accepted his lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is your Society still alive?&#8221; she asked with casual
polite disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going strong!&#8221; said Mr. Cowl. &#8220;More flourishing
than ever&mdash;in spite of our bad luck.&#8221; He lifted his sandy-coloured
eyebrows. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m here on Society business.
In fact, I often have to come to Paris on Society
business.&#8221; His glance deprecated the appearance of the
table over which his rounded form was protruding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to have seen you again,&#8221; said Audrey,
holding out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Mr. Cowl, drawing some tickets from
his pocket. &#8220;I wonder whether you&mdash;and your friends&mdash;would
care to go to a concert to-night at the Salle Xavier.
The concierge at my hotel is giving tickets away, and I
took some&mdash;rather to oblige him than anything else. For
one never knows when a concierge may not be useful. I
don&#8217;t suppose it will be anything great, but it will pass the
time, and&mdash;er&mdash;strangers in Paris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Cowl, but I&#8217;m not a stranger in Paris.
I live here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Mr. Cowl. &#8220;Excuse
me. Then you won&#8217;t take them? Pity! I hate to see
anything wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey was both desolated and infuriated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember me respectfully to Miss Ingate, please,&#8221;
finished Mr. Cowl. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t see me as she passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned the tickets to his pocket.</p>

<p>Outside, Madame Piriac, standing by her automobile,
which had rolled up with the silence of an hallucination,
took leave of Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Eh bien! Au revoir!</em>&#8220; said she shortly, with a peculiar
challenging half-smile, which seemed to be saying, &#8220;Are you
going to be worthy of my education? Let us hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Miss Nickall, with her grey hair growing fluffier
under a somewhat rakish hat, said with a smile of sheer
intense watchful benevolence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>While Nick was ecstatically thanking Mr. Gilman for
his hospitality, Tommy called Audrey aside. Madame
Piriac&#8217;s car had vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard about the rehearsal this morning?&#8221;
she asked, in a confidential tone, anxious and yet quizzical.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! What about it?&#8221; Audrey demanded. Various
apprehensions were competing for attention in her brain.
The episode of Mr. Cowl had agitated her considerably.
And now she was standing right against the column
bearing Musa&#8217;s name in those large letters, and other
columns up and down the gay, busy street echoed clear
the name. And how unreal it was!... Tickets being
given away in half-dozens!... She ought to have been
profoundly disturbed by such a revelation, and she was.
But here was the drive with Mr. Gilman insisting on a
monopoly of all her faculties. And on the top of everything&mdash;Tommy
with her strange gaze and tone! Tommy
carefully hesitated before replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lost his temper and left it in the middle&mdash;orchestra
and conductor and Xavier and all! And he swore he
wouldn&#8217;t play to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the two women were addressing each other
as foes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man I know in the orchestra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us at once&mdash;when you came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t want to spoil the luncheon. But of
course I ought to have done. You, at any rate, seeing
your interest in the concert! I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My interest in the concert?&#8221; Audrey objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my girl,&#8221; said Tommy, half cajolingly and half
threateningly, &#8220;you aren&#8217;t going to stand there and tell
me to my face that you haven&#8217;t put up that concert
for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put up the concert! Put up the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Audrey knew
she was blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paid for it! Paid for it!&#8221; said Tommy, with
impatience.</p>

<h3>GENIUS AT BAY</h3>

<p>Audrey got away from the group in front of the restaurant
with stammering words and crimson confusion. She ran.
She stopped a taxi and stumbled into it. There remained
with her vividly the vision of the startled, entirely puzzled
face of Mr. Gilman, who in an instant had been transformed
from a happy, dignified and excusably self-satisfied
human male into an outraged rebel whose grievance had
overwhelmed his dignity. She had said hurriedly: &#8220;Please
excuse me not coming with you. But Tommy says something&#8217;s
happened to Musa, and I must go and see. It&#8217;s
very important.&#8221; And that was all she had said. Had
she asked him to drive her to Musa&#8217;s, Mr. Gilman would
have been very pleased to do so; but she did not think
of that till it was too late. Her precipitancy had been
terrible, and had staggered even Tommy. She had no
idea how the group would arrange itself. And she had
no very clear idea as to what was wrong with Musa or
how matters stood in regard to the concert. Tommy had
asserted that she did not know whether the orchestra and
its conductor meant to be at their desks in the evening
just as though nothing whatever had occurred at the
rehearsal. All was vague, and all was disturbing. She
had asked Tommy the authority for her assertion that
she, Audrey, was financing the concert. To which Tommy
had replied that she had &#8220;guessed, of course.&#8221; And seeing
that Audrey had only interviewed a concert agent once&mdash;and
he a London concert agent with relations in Paris
&mdash;and that she had never uttered a word about the affair
to anybody except Mr. Foulger, who had been keeping
an eye on the expenditure, it was not improbable that
Tommy had just guessed. But she had guessed right.
She was an uncanny woman. &#8220;Have you ever spoken
to Musa about&mdash;it?&#8221; Audrey had passionately demanded;
and Tommy had answered also passionately: &#8220;Of course
not. I&#8217;m a white woman all through. Haven&#8217;t you learnt
that yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>The taxi, although it was a horse-taxi and incapable of
moving at more than five miles an hour, reached the Rue
Cassette, which was on the other side of the river and
quite a long way off, in no time. That is to say, Audrey
was not aware that any time had passed. She had
received the address from Tommy, for it was a new
address, Musa having admittedly risen in the world. The
house was an old one; it had a curious staircase, with
china knobs on the principal banisters of the rail, and
crimson-tasselled bell cords at all the doors of the flats.
Musa lived at the summit of it. Audrey arrived there
short of breath, took the crimson-tasselled cord in her
hand to pull, and then hesitated in order to think.</p>

<p>Why had she come? The response was clear. She
had come solely because she hated to see a job botched,
and there was not a moment to lose if it was not to be
botched. She had come, not because she had the slightest
sympathetic interest in Musa&mdash;on the contrary, she was
coldly angry with him&mdash;but because she had a horror of
fiascos. She had found a genius who needed financing,
and she, possessing some tons of money, had financed
him, and she did not mean to see an ounce of her money
wasted if she could help it. Her interest in the affair
was artistic and impersonal, and none other. It was the
duty of wealthy magnates to foster art, and she was
fostering art, and she would have the thing done neatly
and completely, or she would know the reason. Fancy
a rational creature making a scene at a final rehearsal
and swearing that he would not play, and then bolting!
It was monstrous! People really did not do such things.
Assuredly no artist had ever done such a thing before.
Artists who had a concert all to themselves invariably
appeared according to advertised promise. An artist who
was only one among several in a programme might fall
ill and fail to appear, for such artists are liable to the
accidents of earthly existence. But an artist who shared
the programme with nobody else was above the accidents
of earthly existence and magically protected against colds,
coughs, influenza, orange peel, automobiles, and all the
other enemies of mankind. But, of course, Musa was
peculiar, erratic and unpredictable beyond even the wide
range granted by society to genius. And yet of late he
had been behaving himself in a marvellous manner. He
had never bothered her. On the voyage back to France
he had not bothered her. They had separated with
punctilious cordiality. Neither of them had written to the
other, but she knew that he was working diligently and
satisfactorily. He was apparently cured of her. It was
perhaps due to the seeming completeness of his cure that
her relations with Mr. Gilman had been what they were.
... And now, suddenly, this!</p>

<p>So with clear conscience she pulled the bell cord.</p>

<p>Musa himself opened the door. He was coatless and
in a dressing-gown, under which showed glimpses of a new
smartness. As soon as he saw her he went very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Bon jour</em>,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He repeated the phrase stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I come in?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He silently signified, with a certain annoying resignation,
that she might. For one instant she was under a
tremendous impulse to walk grandly and haughtily down the
stairs. But she conquered the impulse. He was so pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, excuse me,&#8221; he said, and preceded her along
a short, narrow passage which ended in an open door leading
into a small room. There was no carpet on the floor of
the passage, and only a quite inadequate rug on the floor
of the room. The furniture was scanty and poor. There
was a table, a music stand, a cheap imitation of a Louis
Quatorze chair, two other chairs, and some piles of music.
No curtains to the window! Not a picture on the walls!
On the table a dusty disorder of small objects, including ash-trays,
and towards the back of it a little account book, open,
with a pencil on it and a low pile of coppers and a silver
ten-sou piece on the top of the coppers. Nevertheless this
interior represented a novel luxuriousness for Musa; for
previously, as Audrey knew, he had lived in one room, and
there was no bed here. The flat, indeed, actually comprised
three rooms. The account book and the pitiful heap
of coins touched her. She had expended much on the enterprise
of launching him to glory, and those coins seemed to
be all that had filtered through to him. The whole dwelling
was pathetic, and she thought of the splendours of her own
daily life, of the absolute unimportance to her of such sums
as would keep Musa in content for a year or for ten years,
and of the grandiose, majestic, dazzling career of herself and
Mr. Gilman when their respective fortunes should be joined
together. And she mysteriously saw Mr. Gilman&#8217;s face
again, and that too was pathetic. Everything was pathetic.
She alone seemed to be hard, dominating, overbearing. Her
conscience waked to fresh activity. Was she losing her
soul? Where were her ideals? Could she really work in
full honesty for the feminist cause as the wife of a man
like Mr. Gilman? He was adorable: she felt in that
moment that she had a genuine affection for him; but could
Mrs. Gilman challenge the police, retort audaciously upon
magistrates, and lie in prison? In a word, could she be a
martyr? Would Mr. Gilman, with all his amenability, consent?
Would she herself consent? Would it not be
ridiculous? Thus her flying, shamed thoughts in front of
the waiting Musa!</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you aren&#8217;t ill?&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Why do you wish that I should
be ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he answered her he removed his open fiddle case, with
the violin inside it, from the Louis Quatorze chair, and
signed to her to sit down. She sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that&mdash;this morning&mdash;at the rehearsal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! You have heard that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought perhaps you were ill. So I came to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frankly, Musa, it is said that you said you would not
play to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it concern you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It concerns everyone.... And you have been so
good lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I have been good lately. You have heard that.
And did you expect me to continue to be good when you
returned to Paris and passed all your days in public with
that antique and grotesque Monsieur Gilman? All the world
sees you. I myself have seen you. It is horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>She controlled herself. And the fact that she was intensely
flattered helped her to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Musa,&#8221; she said, firmly and kindly, as on previous
occasions she had spoken to him. &#8220;Do be reasonable. I
refuse to be angry, and it is impossible for you to insult me,
however much you try. But do be reasonable. Do think
of the future. We are all wishing for your success. We
shall all be there. And now you say you aren&#8217;t going to
play. It is really too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have perhaps bought tickets,&#8221; said Musa, and a
flush gradually spread over his cheeks. &#8220;You have perhaps
bought tickets, and you are afraid lest you have been
robbed. Tranquillise yourself, Madame. If you have the
least fear, I will instruct my agent to reimburse you. And
why should I not play? Naturally I shall play. Accept my
word, if you can.&#8221; He spoke with an icy and convincing
decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; Audrey murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;What right have you to be glad, Madame? If you are
glad it is your own affair. Have I troubled you since we
last met? I need the sympathy of nobody. I am assured
of a large audience. My impresario is excessively optimistic.
And if this is so, I owe it to none but myself. You speak
of insults. Permit me to say that I regard your patronage
as an insult. I have done nothing, I imagine, to deserve
it. I crack my head to divine what I have done to deserve
it. You hear some silly talk about a rehearsal and you
precipitate yourself <em>chez moi</em>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word Audrey rose and departed. He followed
her to the door and held it open.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Bon jour</em>, Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>She descended the stairs. Perhaps it was his sudden
illogical change of tone; perhaps it was the memory of his
phrase, &#8220;assured of a large audience,&#8221; coupled with a
picture of the sinister Mr. Cowl unsuccessfully trying to
give away tickets&mdash;but whatever was the origin of the sob,
she did give a sob. As she walked downcast through the
courtyard she heard clearly the sounds of Musa&#8217;s violin,
played with savage vigour.</p>

<h3>FINANCIAL NEWS</h3>

<p>The Salle Xavier, or Xavier Hall, had been built, with
other people&#8217;s money, by Xavier in order to force the
general public to do something which the general public
does not want to do and never would do of its own accord.
Namely, to listen to high-class music. It had not been built,
and it was not run, strange to say, to advertise a certain
brand of piano. Xavier was an old Jew, of surpassing
ugliness, from Cracow or some such place. He looked a
rascal, and he was one&mdash;admittedly; he himself would imply
it, if not crudely admit it. He had no personal interest in
music, either high-class or low-class. But he possessed a
gift for languages and he had mixed a great deal with
musicians in an informal manner. Wagner, at Venice, had
once threatened Xavier with a stick, and also Xavier had
twice run away with great exponents of the rôle of Isolde.
His competence as a connoisseur of Wagner&#8217;s music, and
of the proper methods of rendering Wagner&#8217;s music, could
therefore not be questioned, and it was not questioned.</p>

<p>He had a habit of initiating grandiose schemes for opera
or concerts and of obtaining money therefor from wealthy
amateurs. After a few months he would return the money
less ten per cent. for preliminary expenses and plus his
regrets that the schemes had unhappily fallen through owing
to unforeseen difficulties. And wealthy amateurs were so
astonished to get ninety per cent. of their money back from
a rascal that they thought him almost an honest man, asked
him to dinner, and listened sympathetically to details of
his next grandiose scheme. The Xavier Hall was one of the
few schemes&mdash;and the only real estate scheme&mdash;that had
ever gone through. With the hall for a centre, Xavier laid
daily his plans and conspiracies for persuading the public
against its will. To this end he employed in large numbers
clerks, printers, bill posters, ticket agents, doorkeepers, programme
writers, programme sellers, charwomen, and even
artists. He always had some new dodge or hope. The hall
was let several times a week for concerts or other entertainments,
and many of them were private speculations of
Xavier. They were nearly all failures. And the hall,
thoroughly accustomed to seeing itself half empty, did not
pay interest on its capital. How could it? Upon occasions
there had actually been more persons in the orchestra than
in the audience. Seated in the foyer, with one eye upon a
shabby programme girl and another upon the street outside,
Xavier would sometimes refer to these facts in conversation
with a titled patron, and would describe the public
realistically and without pretence of illusion. Nevertheless,
Xavier had grown to be a rich man, for percentages were his
hourly food; he received them even from programme sellers.
At nine o&#8217;clock the hall was rather less than half full,
and this was rightly regarded as very promising, for the
management, like the management of every place of distraction
in Paris, held it a point of honour to start from twenty
to thirty minutes late&mdash;as though all Parisians had many
ages ago decided that in Paris one could not be punctual,
and that, long since tired of waiting for each other, they
had entered into a competition to make each other wait, the
individual who arrived last being universally regarded as
the winner. The members of the orchestra were filing
negligently in from the back of the vast terraced platform,
yawning, and ravaged by the fearful ennui of eternal high-class
music. They entered in dozens and scores, and they
kept on entering, and as they gazed inimically at each other,
fingering their instruments, their pale faces seemed to be
asking: &#8220;Why should it be necessary to collect so many
of us in order to prove that just one single human being
can play the violin? We can all play the violin, or something
else just as good. And we have all been geniuses in
our time.&#8221;</p>

<p>In strong contrast to their fatigued and disastrous indifference
was the demeanour of a considerable group of
demonstrators in the gallery. This body had crossed the
Seine from the sacred Quarter, and, not owning a wardrobe
sufficiently impressive to entitle it to ask for free seats, it
had paid for its seats. Hence naturally its seats were the
worst in the hall. But the group did not care. It was
capable of exciting itself about high-class music. Moreover
it had, for that night, an article of religious faith, to
wit, that Musa was the greatest violinist that had ever lived
or ever could live, and it was determined to prove this article
of faith by sheer force of hands and feet. Therefore it was
very happy, and just a little noisy.</p>

<p>In the main part of the hall the audience could be
divided into two species, one less numerous than the other.
First, the devotees of music, who went to nearly every
concert, extremely knowing, extremely blasé, extremely
disdainful and fastidious, with precise views about every
musical composition, every conductor, and every performer;
weary of melodious nights at which the same melodies were
ever heard, but addicted to them, as some people are
addicted to vices equally deleterious. These devotees would
have had trouble with their conscience or their instincts had
they not, by coming to the concert, put themselves in a
position to affirm exactly and positively what manner of a
performer Musa was. They had no hope of being pleased
by him. Indeed they knew beforehand that he was yet
another false star, but they had to ascertain the truth for
themselves, because&mdash;you see&mdash;there was a slight chance
that he might be a genuine star, in which case their careers
would have been ruined had they not been able to say to
succeeding generations: &#8220;I was at his first concert. It was
a memorable,&#8221; etc. etc. They were an emaciated tribe,
and in fact had the air of mummies temporarily revived and
escaped out of museums. They were shabby, but not with
the gallery shabbiness; they were shabby because shabbiness
was part of their unworldly refinement; and it did not
matter&mdash;they would have got their free seats even if they
had come in sacks and cerements.</p>

<p>The second main division of the audience&mdash;and the
larger&mdash;consisted of the jolly pleasure seekers, who had
dined well, who respected Beethoven no more than Oscar
Straus, and who demanded only one boon&mdash;not to be bored.
They had full dimpled cheeks, and they were adequately
attired, and they dropped cigarettes with reluctance in the
foyer, and they entered adventurously with marked courage,
well aware that they had come to something queer and
dangerous, something that was neither a revue nor a
musical comedy, and, while hoping optimistically for the
best, determined to march boldly out again in the event
of the worst. They had seven mortal evenings a week to
dispose of somehow, and occasionally they were obliged to
take risks. Their expressions for the most part had that
condescension which is characteristic of those who take a
risk without being paid for it.</p>

<p>All around the hall ran a horseshoe of private boxes,
between the balcony and the gallery. These boxes gradually
filled. At a quarter-past nine over half of them were
occupied; which fact, combined with the stylishness of the
hats in them, proved that Xavier had immense skill in
certain directions, and that on that night, for some reason
or other, he had been doing his very best.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes past nine the audience had coalesced
and become an entity, and the group from the Quarter was
stamping an imitation of the first bars of the C minor
Symphony, to indicate that further delay might involve
complications.</p>

<p>Audrey sat with Miss Ingate modestly and inconspicuously
in the fifth row of the stalls. Miss Ingate, prodigious
in crimson, was in a state of beatitude, because she
never went to concerts and imagined that she had inadvertently
slipped into heaven. The mere size of the
orchestra so overwhelmed her that she was convinced that
it was an orchestra specially enlarged to meet the unique
importance of Musa&#8217;s genius. &#8220;They <em>must</em> think highly of
him!&#8221; she said. She employed the time in looking about
her. She had already found, besides many other Anglo-Saxon
acquaintances, Rosamund, in black, Tommy with
Nick, and Mr. Cowl, who was one seat to Audrey&#8217;s left in
the sixth row of the stalls. Also Mr. Gilman and Madame
Piriac and Monsieur Piriac in a double box. Audrey and
herself ought to have been in that box, and had the afternoon
developed otherwise they probably would have been in that
box. Fortunately at the luncheon, Audrey, who had
bought various lots of seats, had with the strange cautiousness
of a young girl left herself free to utilise or not to
utilise the offered hospitality of Mr. Gilman&#8217;s double box,
and Mr. Gilman had not pressed her for a decision. Was
it not important that the hall should seem as full as
possible? When Miss Ingate, pushing her investigations
farther, had discovered not merely Monsieur Dauphin, but
Mr. Ziegler, late of Frinton and now resident in Paris, her
cup was full.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s vehy wonderful, <em>vehy</em> wonderful!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>But it was Audrey who most deeply had the sense of
the wonderfulness of the thing. For it was Audrey who
had created it. Having months ago comprehended that a
formal and splendid debut was necessary for Musa if he
was to succeed within a reasonable space of time, she had
willed the debut within her own brain. She alone had
thought of it. And now the realisation seemed to her to be
absolutely a miracle. Had she read of such an affair a
year earlier in a newspaper&mdash;with the words &#8220;Paris,&#8221; &#8220;<em>tout
Paris</em>,&#8221; &#8220;young genius,&#8221; and so on&mdash;she would have
pictured it as gloriously, thrillingly romantic, and it indeed
was gloriously and thrillingly romantic. She thought:
&#8220;None of these people sitting around me know that
I have brought it about, and that it is all mine.&#8221; The
thought was sweet. She felt like an invisible African genie
out of the Thousand and One Nights.</p>

<p>And yet what had she done to bring it about? Nothing,
simply nothing, except to command it! She had not even
signed cheques. Mr. Foulger had signed the cheques! Mr.
Foulger, who set down the whole enterprise as incomprehensible
lunacy! Mr. Foulger, who had never been to
aught but a smoking-concert in his life, and who could
not pronounce the name of Beethoven without hesitations!
The great deed had cost money, and it would cost more
money; it would probably cost four hundred pounds ere it
was finished with. An extravagant sum, but Xavier had
motor-cars and toys even more expensive than motor-cars
to keep up! Audrey, however, considered it a small sum,
compared to the terrific spectacular effect obtained. And
she was right. The attributes of money seemed entirely
magical to her. And she was right again. She respected
money with a new respect. And she respected herself for
using money with such large grandeur.</p>

<p>And withal she was most horribly nervous, just as
nervous as though it was she who was doomed to face
the indifferent and exacting audience with nothing but a
violin bow for weapon. She was so nervous that she
could not listen, could not even follow Miss Ingate&#8217;s simple
remarks; she heard them as from a long distance, and
grasped them after a long interval. Still, she was uplifted,
doughty, and proud. The humiliation of the afternoon had
vanished like a mist. Nay, she felt glad that Musa had
behaved to her just as he did behave. His mien pleased
her; his wounding words, each of which she clearly remembered,
were a source of delight. She had never
admired him so much. She had now no resentment against
him. He had proved that her hopes of him were, after all,
well justified. He would succeed. Only some silly and improbable
accident could stop him from succeeding. She
was not nervous about his success. She was nervous for
him. She became him. She tuned his fiddle, gathered
herself together and walked on to the platform, bowed to
the dim multitudinous heads in front of him, looked at the
conductor, waited for the opening bars, drew his bow
across his strings at precisely the correct second, and heard
the resulting sound under her ear. And all that before the
conductor had appeared! Such were the manifestations of
her purely personal desire for the achievement of a neat,
clean job.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;Mr. Gilman is bowing to
us. He does look splendid, and isn&#8217;t Madame Piriac lovely?
I must say I don&#8217;t care so much for these French husbands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey had to turn and join Miss Ingate in acknowledging
the elaborate bow. At any rate, then, Mr. Gilman had
not been utterly estranged by her capricious abandonment of
him. And why should he be? He was a man of sense;
he would understand perfectly when she explained to-morrow.
Further, he was her slave. She was sure of him. She
would apologise to him. She would richly recompense him
by smiles and honey and charming persuasive simplicity.
And he would see that with all her innocent and modest
ingenuousness she was capable of acting seriously and
effectively in a sudden crisis. She would rise higher in
his esteem. As for the foreseen proposal, well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A sporadic clapping wakened her out of those reflections.
The conductor was approaching his desk. The orchestra
applauded him. He tapped the desk and raised his stick.
And there was a loud noise, the thumping of her heart.
The concert had begun. Musa was still invisible&mdash;what
was he doing at that instant, somewhere behind?&mdash;but the
concert had begun. Stars do not take part in the first
item of an orchestral concert. There is a convention that
they shall be preluded; and Musa was preluded by the
overture to <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. In the soft second section
of the overture, a most noticeable babble came from a
stage-box. &#8220;Oh! It&#8217;s the Foas,&#8221; muttered Miss Ingate.
&#8220;What a lot of people are fussing around them!&#8221; &#8220;Hsh!&#8221;
frowned Audrey, outraged by the interruption. Madame
Foa took about fifty bars in which to settle herself, and
Monsieur Foa chattered to people behind him as freely as
if he had been in a café Nobody seemed to mind.</p>

<p>The overture was applauded, but Madame Foa, instead
of applauding, leaned gracefully back, smiling, and waved
somebody to the seat beside her.</p>

<p>Violent demonstrations from the gallery!... He was
there, tripping down the stepped pathway between the
drums. The demonstrations grew general. The orchestra
applauded after its own fashion. He reached the conductor,
smiled at the conductor and bowed very admirably.
He seemed to be absolutely at his ease. Then there was
a delay. The conductor&#8217;s scores had got themselves mixed
up. It was dreadful. It was enough to make a woman
shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221; said a voice in Audrey&#8217;s ear. She turned as
if shot. Mr. Cowl&#8217;s round face was close to hers. &#8220;I
suppose you saw the <em>New York Herald</em> this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Audrey impatiently.</p>

<p>The orchestra started the Beethoven violin Concerto.
But Mr. Cowl kept his course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;About the Zacatecas Oil
Corporation? It&#8217;s under a receivership. It&#8217;s gone smash.
I&#8217;ve had an idea for some time it would. All due to these
Mexican revolutions. I thought you might like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa&#8217;s bow hung firmly over the strings.</p>

<h3>INTERVAL</h3>

<p>The most sinister feature of entertainments organised by
Xavier was the intervals. Xavier laid stress on intervals;
they gave repose, and in many cases they saved money. All
Paris managers are inclined to give to the interval the
importance of a star turn, and Xavier in this respect surpassed
his rivals, though he perhaps regarded his cloak-rooms,
which were organised to cause the largest possible
amount of inconvenience to the largest possible number of
people, as his surest financial buttress. Xavier could or
would never see the close resemblance of intervals to wet
blankets, extinguishers, palls and hostile critics. The
Allegro movement of the Concerto was a real success, and
the audience as a whole would have applauded even more if
the gallery in particular had not applauded so much. The
second or Larghetto movement was also a success, but to a
less degree. As for the third and last movement, it put the
gallery into an ecstasy while leaving the floor in possession
of full critical faculties. Musa retired and had to return,
and when he returned the floor good-humouredly joined the
vociferous gallery in laudations, and he had to return again.
Then the interminable interval. Silence! Murmurings!
Silence! Creepings towards exits! And in many, very
many hearts the secret trouble question: &#8220;Why are we
here? What have we come for? What is all this pother
about art and genius? Honestly, shall we not be glad and
relieved when the solemn old thing is over?"... And
the desolating, cynical indifference of the conductor and the
orchestra! Often there is a clearer vision of the truth
during the intervals of a classical concert than on a
deathbed.</p>

<p>Audrey was extremely depressed in the interval after
the Beethoven Concerto and before the Lalo. But she was
not depressed by the news of the accident to the Zacatecas
Oil Corporation in which was the major part of her wealth.
The tidings had stunned rather than injured that part of her
which was capable of being affected by finance. She had
not felt the blow. Moreover she was protected by the
knowledge that she had thousands of pounds in hand and
also the Moze property intact, and further she was already
reconsidering her newly-acquired respect for money. No!
What depressed her was a doubt as to the genius of Musa.
In the long dreadful pause it seemed impossible that he
should have genius. The entire concert presented itself as
a grotesque farce, of which she as its creator ought to be
ashamed. She was ready to kill Xavier or his responsible
representative.</p>

<p>Then she saw the tall and calm Rosamund, with her
grey hair and black attire and her subduing self-complacency,
making a way between the rows of stalls towards
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see you,&#8221; said Rosamund, after the formal
greetings. &#8220;Very much.&#8221; Her voice was as kind and as
unrelenting as the grave.</p>

<p>At this point Miss Ingate ought to have yielded her
seat to the terrific Rosamund, but she failed to do so,
doubtless by inadvertence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come into the foyer for a moment?&#8221; Rosamund
inflexibly suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the interval nearly over?&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>And as a fact there was not the slightest sign of the
interval being nearly over. Audrey obediently rose. But
the invitation had been so conspicuously addressed to herself
that Miss Ingate, gathering her wits, remained in her
chair.</p>

<p>The foyer&mdash;decorated in the Cracovian taste&mdash;was dotted
with cigarette smokers and with those who had fled from
the interval. Rosamund did not sit down; she did not try
for seclusion in a corner. She stepped well into the foyer,
and then stood still, and absently lighted a cigarette,
omitting to offer a cigarette to Audrey. Rosamund&#8217;s air of
a deaconess made the cigarette extremely remarkable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell you about Jane Foley,&#8221; began
Rosamund quietly. &#8220;Have you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you haven&#8217;t. I alone knew. She has run
away to England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run away! But she&#8217;ll be caught!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may be. But that is not all. She has run away
to get married. She dared not tell me. She wrote me.
She put the letter in the manuscript of the last chapter
but one of her book, which I am revising for her. She will
almost certainly be caught if she tries to get married in
her own name. Therefore she will get married in a false
name. All this, however, is not what I wanted to tell
you about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you shouldn&#8217;t have begun to talk about it,&#8221; said
Audrey suddenly. &#8220;Did you expect me to let you leave it
in the middle! Jane getting married! I do think she
might have told me.... What next, I wonder! I suppose
you&#8217;ve&mdash;er&mdash;lost her now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not entirely, I believe,&#8221; said Rosamund. &#8220;Certainly
not entirely. But of course I could never trust her again.
This is the worst blow I have ever had. She says&mdash;but why
go into that? Well, she does say she will work as hard
as ever, nearly; and that her future husband strongly
supports us&mdash;and so on.&#8221; Rosamund smiled with complete
detachment.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s he?&#8221; Audrey demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;His name is Aguilar,&#8221; said Rosamund. &#8220;So she says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aguilar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I gather&mdash;I say I gather&mdash;that he belongs to
the industrial class. But of course that is precisely the
class that Jane springs from. Odd! Is it not? Heredity,
I presume.&#8221; She raised her shoulders.</p>

<p>Audrey said nothing. She was too shocked to speak&mdash;not
pained or outraged, but simply shaken. What in the
name of Juno could Jane see in Aguilar? Jane, to whom
every man was the hereditary enemy! Aguilar, who had
no use for either man or woman! Aguilar, a man without
a Christian name, one of those men in connection with
whom a Christian name is impossibly ridiculous. How
should she, Audrey, address Aguilar in future? Would he
have to be asked to tea? These vital questions naturally
transcended all others in Audrey&#8217;s mind.... Still (she
veered round), it was perhaps after all just the union that
might have been expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Rosamund at length, &#8220;I have a
question to put to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a definite answer here and now.&#8221; She
looked round disdainfully at the foyer. &#8220;But I do want
to set your mind on the right track at the earliest possible
moment&mdash;before any accidents occur.&#8221; She smiled
satirically. &#8220;You see how frank I am with you. I&#8217;ll be
more frank still, and tell you that I came to this concert
to-night specially to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; Audrey murmured. &#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>The older woman looked down upon her from a superior
height. Her eyes were those of an autocrat. It was
quite possible to see in them the born leader who had
dominated thousands of women and played a drawn game
with the British Government itself. But Audrey, at the
very moment when she was feeling the overbearing magic
of that gaze, happened to remember the scene in Madame
Piriac&#8217;s automobile on the night of her first arrival in
Paris, when she herself was asleep and Rosamund, not
knowing that she was asleep, had been solemnly addressing
her. Miss Ingate&#8217;s often repeated account of the scene
always made her laugh, and the memory of it now caused
her to smile faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to suggest to you,&#8221; Rosamund proceeded,
&#8220;that you begin to work for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the suffrage&mdash;or for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the same thing,&#8221; said Rosamund coldly. &#8220;I
am the suffrage. Without me the cause would not have
existed to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;of course I will. I have done
a bit already, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; Rosamund admitted. &#8220;You did very
well at the Blue City. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m approaching you.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve chosen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chosen me for what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that a new great campaign will soon begin.
It is all arranged. It will necessitate my returning to
England and challenging the police. You know also that
Jane Foley was to have been my lieutenant-in-chief&mdash;for
the active part of the operation. You will admit that I
can no longer count on her completely. Will you take
her place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can. I dare
say I shan&#8217;t have much money, because one of those
&#8217;accidents&#8217; you mentioned has happened to me already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That need not trouble you,&#8221; replied Rosamund imperturbable.
&#8220;I have always been able to get all the
money that was needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll help all I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I ask,&#8221; said Rosamund inflexibly.
&#8220;Will you take Jane Foley&#8217;s place? Will you give yourself
utterly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey answered with sudden vehemence:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t. You didn&#8217;t want a definite answer, but
there it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you believe in the cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the greatest of all causes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rather inclined to think it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not give yourself, then? You are free. I have
given myself, my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Audrey, who resented the appellation of
&#8220;child.&#8221; &#8220;But, you see, it&#8217;s your hobby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hobby, Mrs. Moncreiff!&#8221; exclaimed Rosamund.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, your hobby,&#8221; Audrey persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sacrificed everything to it,&#8221; said Rosamund.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve
sacrificed anything to it. You just enjoy bossing other
people above everything, and it gives you every chance
to boss. And you enjoy plots too, and look at the chances
you get for that&#8217;. Mind you, I like you for it. I think
you&#8217;re splendid. Only <em>I</em> don&#8217;t want to be a monomaniac,
and I won&#8217;t be.&#8221; Her convictions seemed to have become
suddenly clear and absolutely decided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to infer that I am a monomaniac?&#8221;
asked Rosamund, raising her eyebrows&mdash;but only a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;as you mentioned frankness&mdash;what
else would you call yourself but a monomaniac?
You only live for one thing&mdash;don&#8217;t you, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the greatest thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Audrey admitted. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve
been thinking a good deal about all this, and at last I&#8217;ve
come to the conclusion that one thing-isn&#8217;t enough for
me, not nearly enough. And I&#8217;m not going to be peculiar
at any price. Neither a fanatic nor a monomaniac, nor
anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in love,&#8221; asserted Rosamund.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if I am? If you ask me, I think a girl
who isn&#8217;t in love ought to be somewhat ashamed of herself,
or at least sorry for herself. And I am sorry for myself,
because I am not in love. I wish I was. Why shouldn&#8217;t
I be? It must be lovely to be in love. If I was in love
I shouldn&#8217;t be <em>only</em> in love. You think you understand
what girls are nowadays, but you don&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t myself
until just lately. But I&#8217;m beginning to. Girls were
supposed to be only interested in one thing&mdash;in your time.
Monomaniacs, that&#8217;s what they had to be. You changed
all that, or you&#8217;re trying to change it, but you only mean
women to be monomaniacs about something else. It isn&#8217;t
good enough. I want everything, and I&#8217;m going to get it&mdash;or
have a good try for it. I&#8217;ll never be a martyr if I can
help it. And I believe I can help it. I believe I&#8217;ve got
just enough common sense to save me from being a martyr
&mdash;either to a husband or a house or family&mdash;or a cause.
I want to have a husband and a house and a family,
and a cause too. That&#8217;ll be just about everything, won&#8217;t
it? And if you imagine I can&#8217;t look after all of them at
once, all I can say is I don&#8217;t agree with you. Because
I&#8217;ve got an idea I can. Supposing I had all these things,
I fancy I could have a tiff with my husband and make
it up, play with my children, alter a dress, change the
furniture, tackle the servants, and go out to a meeting
and perhaps have a difficulty with the police&mdash;all in one
day. Only if I did get into trouble with the police I
should pay the fine&mdash;you see. The police aren&#8217;t going to
have me altogether. Nobody is. Nobody, man or woman,
is going to be able to boast that he&#8217;s got me altogether.
You think you&#8217;re independent. But you aren&#8217;t. We girls
will show you what independence is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a rather surprising young creature,&#8221; observed
Rosamund with a casual air, unmoved. &#8220;You&#8217;re quite
excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I surprise myself. But these things do come
in bursts. I&#8217;ve noticed that before. They weren&#8217;t clear
when you began to talk. They&#8217;re clear now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you this,&#8221; said Rosamund. &#8220;A cause
must have martyrs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; Audrey protested. &#8220;I should have
thought common sense would be lots more useful than
martyrs. And monomaniacs never do have common
sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that meant for an insult, or is it just a statement?&#8221;
Audrey laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>And Rosamund laughed too.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a statement,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s another statement,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;You&#8217;re
very old. That&#8217;s where I have the advantage of you.
Still, tell me what I can do in your new campaign, and
I&#8217;ll do it if I can. But there isn&#8217;t going to be any utterly
&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the interval is over,&#8221; said Rosamund with
finality. &#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better adjourn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foyer had nearly emptied. The distant sound of
music could be heard.</p>

<p>As she was re-entering the hall, Audrey met Mr. Cowl,
who was coming out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have decided I can&#8217;t stand any more,&#8221; Mr. Cowl
remarked in a loud whisper. &#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t mind
me telling you about the Zacatecas. As I said, I thought
you might be interested. Good-bye. So pleasant to have
met you again, dear lady.&#8221; His face had the same
enigmatic smile which had made him so formidable at
Moze.</p>

<p>Musa had already begun to play the Spanish Symphony
of Lalo, without which no genius is permitted to make
his formal debut on the violin in France.</p>




<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_43" id="chapter_43" />CHAPTER XLIII</h2>


<h3>ENTR&#8217;ACTE</h3>

<p>After the Spanish Symphony not only the conductor but
the entire orchestra followed Musa from the platform, and
Audrey understood that the previous interval had not really
been an interval and that the first genuine interval was
about to begin. The audience seemed to understand this
too, for practically the whole of it stood up and moved
towards the doors. Audrey would have stayed in her
seat, but Miss Ingate expressed a desire to go out and
&#8220;see the fun&#8221; in the foyer, and, moreover, she asserted
that the Foas from their box had been signalling to her
and Audrey an intention to meet them in the foyer. Miss
Ingate was in excellent spirits. She said it beat her how
Musa&#8217;s fingers could get through so many notes in so
short a time, and also that it made her feel tired even
to watch the fingers. She was convinced that nobody had
ever handled the violin so marvellously before. As for
success, Musa had been recalled, and the applause from
the gallery, fired by its religious belief, was obstinate and
extremely vociferous. Audrey, however, was aware of
terrible sick qualms, for she knew that Musa was not so
far dominating his public. Much of the applause had
obviously the worst quality that applause can have&mdash;it was
good-natured. Yet she could not accept failure for Musa.
Failure would be too monstrous an injustice, and therefore
it could not happen.</p>

<p>The emptiness of the Foas&#8217; box indicated that Miss
Ingate might be correct in her interpretation of signals,
and Audrey allowed herself to be led away from the now
forlorn auditorium. As they filed along the gangways she
had to listen to the indifferent remarks of utterly unprejudiced
and uninterested persons about the performance
of genius, and further she had to learn that a fair proportion
of them were departing with no intention to return.
In the thronged foyer they saw Mr. Gilman, alone, before
he saw them. He was carrying a box of chocolates&mdash;doubtless
one of the little things that Mr. Price had had
instructions to provide for the evening, Mr. Gilman perhaps
would not have caught sight of them had it not been
for the stridency of Miss Ingate&#8217;s voice, which caused him
to turn round.</p>

<p>Audrey experienced once again the sensation&mdash;which
latterly was apt to recur in her&mdash;of having too many
matters on her mind simultaneously; in a phrase, the
sensation of the exceeding complexity of existence. And
she resented it. The interview with Rosamund was quite
enough for one night. It had been a triumph for her; she
had surprised herself in that interview; it had left her with
a conviction of freedom; it had uplifted her. She ought
to have been in a state of exaltation after that interview,
and she was. Only, while in a state of exaltation, she
was still in the old state of depression&mdash;about the tendency
of the concert, of her concert, and about the rumoured
disappearance of her fortune. Also she was preoccupied
by the very strange affair of Jane Foley and Aguilar.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;a further intricacy of mood&mdash;came a whole
new set of emotions due to the mere spectacle of Mr.
Gilman&#8217;s august back! She was intimidated by Mr. Gilman&#8217;s
back. She knew horribly that in the afternoon she had
treated Mr. Gilman as Mr. Gilman ought never to have
been treated. And, quite apart from intimidation, she had
another feeling, a feeling which was ghastly and of which
she was ashamed.... Assuming the disappearance of her
fortune, would Mr. Gilman&#8217;s attitude towards her be thereby
changed? ... She admitted that young girls ought not
to have such suspicions against respectable and mature
men of established position in the world. Nevertheless,
she could not blow the suspicion away.</p>

<p>But the instant Mr. Gilman&#8217;s eye met hers the suspicion
vanished, and not the suspicion only, but all her
intimidation. The miracle was produced by something in
the gaze of Mr. Gilman as it rested on her, something
wistful&mdash;not more definable than that, something which she
had noticed in Mr. Gilman&#8217;s gaze on other occasions. It
perfectly restored her. It gave her the positive assurance
of a fact which marvellously enheartens young girls of
about Audrey&#8217;s years&mdash;to wit, that they have a mysterious
power surpassing the power of age, knowledge, wisdom,
or wealth, that they influence and decide the course of
history, and are the sole true mistresses of the world.
Whence the mysterious power sprang she did not exactly
know, but she surmised&mdash;rightly&mdash;that it was connected
with her youth, with a dimple, with the incredibly soft
down on her cheek, with the arch softness of her glance,
with a gesture of the hand, with a turn of the shoulder,
with a pleat of the skirt.... Anyhow, she possessed it,
and to possess it was to wield it. It transformed her
into a delicious tyrant, but a tyrant; it inspired her with
exquisite cruelty, but cruelty. Her thoughts might have
been summed up in eight words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! He has suffered. Well, he must suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah! But she meant to be very kind to him. He was
so reliable, so adorable, and so dependent. She had
genuine affection for him. And he was at once a rock
and a cushion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it going splendidly&mdash;splendidly, Mr. Gilman?&#8221;
exclaimed Miss Ingate in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman, with comfort in his
voice.</p>

<p>At that moment the musical critic with large, dark
Eastern eyes, whom Audrey had met at the Foas&#8217;, strolled
nonchalantly by, and, perceiving Miss Ingate, described a
huge and perfect curve in the air with his glossy silk hat,
which had been tipped at the back of his head. Mr.
Gilman had come close to Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Foas started down with me,&#8221; said Mr. Gilman
mildly. &#8220;But they always meet such crowds of acquaintances
at these affairs that they seldom get anywhere.
Hortense would not leave the box. She never will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;ve seen you,&#8221; Audrey began
excitedly, but with simplicity and compelling sweetness.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve no idea how sorry I am about this afternoon!
I&#8217;m frightfully sorry, really! But I was so upset. I
didn&#8217;t know what to do. You know how anxious everybody
was about Musa for to-night. He&#8217;s the pet of the
Quarter, and, of course, I belong to the Quarter. At
least&mdash;I did. I thought he might be ill, or something.
However, it was all right in the end. I was looking
forward tremendously to that drive. Are you going to
forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please!&#8221; he eagerly entreated, with a faint
blush. &#8220;Of course, I quite understand. There&#8217;s nothing
whatever to forgive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but there is,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Only you&#8217;re so
good-natured.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was being magnanimous. She was pretending that
she had no mysterious power. But her motive was quite
pure. If he was good-natured, so was she. She honestly
wanted to recompense him, and to recompense him richly.
And she did. Her demeanour was enchanting in its ingenuous
flattery. She felt happy despite all her anxieties,
for he was living up to her ideal of him. She felt happy,
and her resolve to make him happy to the very limit of
his dreams was intense. She had a vision of her future
existence stretching out in front of her, and there was
not a shadow on it. She thought he was going to offer
her the box of chocolates, but he did not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather wanted to ask your advice,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>Just then the Foas arrived, and with them Dauphin,
the great and fashionable painter and the original discoverer
of Musa. And as they all began to speak at once
Audrey heard the Oriental musical critic say slowly to an
inquiring Miss Ingate:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a concert talent that he has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear! You hear!&#8221; exclaimed Monsieur Foa to
Monsieur Dauphin and Madame Foa, with an impressed
air. &#8220;You hear what Miquette says. He has not a
concert talent. He has everything that you like, but not
a concert talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foa seemed to be exhibiting the majestic Oriental, nicknamed
Miquette, as the final arbiter, whose word settled
problems like a sword, and Miquette seemed to be trying
to bear the high rôle with negligent modesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, yes, he has! But, yes, he has!&#8221; Dauphin protested,
sweeping all Miquettes politely away. And then
there was an urbane riot of greetings, salutes, bowings,
smilings, cooings and compliments.</p>

<p>Dauphin was magnificent, playing the part of the
opulent painter <em>à la mode</em> with the most finished skill,
the most splendid richness of detail. It was notorious that
in the evenings he wore the finest silk shirts in Paris,
and his waistcoat was designed to give scope to these
shirts. He might have come&mdash;he probably had come&mdash;straight
from the bower of archduchesses; but he produced
in Audrey the illusion that archduchesses were a trifle
compared to herself. He had not seen her for a long
time. Gazing at her, he breathed relief; all his features
indicated the sudden, unexpected assuaging of eternal and
intense desires. He might have been travelling through
the desert for many days and she might have been the
oasis&mdash;the pool of living water and the palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;like that! Just like that!&#8221; he said, holding
her hand and, as it were, hypnotising her in the pose in
which she happened to be. He looked hard at her.
&#8220;It is unique. Madame, where did you find that
dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Callot,&#8221; answered Audrey submissively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so. Well, Madame, I can wait no more.
I will wait no more. It is Dauphin who implores you to
come to his studio. To come&mdash;it is your duty. Madame
Foa, you will bring her. I count on you absolutely to
bring her. Even if it is only to be a sketch&mdash;the merest
hint. But I must do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Madame,&#8221; said Madame Foa with all the
Italian charm. &#8220;Dauphin must paint you. The contrary
is unthinkable. My husband and I have often said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221; Dauphin suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! To-morrow, my little Dauphin, I cannot,&#8221; said
Madame Foa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day after to-morrow, then. I will send my auto.
What address? Half-past eleven. That goes? In any
case, I insist. Be kind! Be kind!&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey blushed. Half the foyer was staring at the
group. She was flattered. She saw herself remarkable.
She thought she would look more particularly, with perfect
detachment, at the mirror that night, in order to decide
whether her appearance was as striking, as original, as
distinguished, as Dauphin&#8217;s attitude implied. There must
surely be something in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;About that advice&mdash;may I call to-morrow?&#8221; It was
Mr. Gilman&#8217;s voice at her elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advice?&#8221; She had forgotten her announced intention
of asking his advice. (The subject was to be Zacatecas.)
&#8220;Oh, yes. How nice of you! Please do call. Come for
tea.&#8221; She was delightful to him, but at the same time
there was in her tone a little of the condescending casualness
proper to the tone of a girl openly admired by the
confidant and painter of princesses and archduchesses, the
man who treated all plain women and women past the
prime with a desolating indifference.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a rotten little snob.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman gave thanksgivings and departed, explaining
that he must return to Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>Foa and Dauphin and the Oriental resumed the argument
about Musa&#8217;s talent and the concert. Miquette would say
nothing as to the success of the concert. Foa asserted
that the concert was not and would not be a success.
Dauphin pooh-poohed and insisted vehemently that the
success was unmistakable and increasing. Moreover, he
criticised the hall, the choice of programme, the orchestra,
the conductor. &#8220;I discovered Musa,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I have
always said that he is a great concert player, and that
he is destined for a great world-success, and to-night I
am more sure of it than ever.&#8221; Whereupon Madame Foa
said with much sympathy that she hoped it was so, and
Foa said: &#8220;You create illusions for yourself, on purpose.&#8221;
Dauphin bore him down with wavy gestures and warm
cries of &#8220;No! No! No!&#8221; And he appealed to Audrey
as-a woman incapable of illusions. And Audrey agreed
with Dauphin. And while she was agreeing she kept
saying to herself: &#8220;Why do I pretend to agree with him?
He is not sincere. He knows he is not sincere. We all
know&mdash;except perhaps Winnie Ingate. The concert is a
failure. If it were not a failure, Madame Foa would not
be so sympathetic. She is more subtle even than Madame
Piriac. I shall never be subtle like that. I wish I could
be. I wish I was at Moze. I am too Essex for all this.
And Winnie here is too comic for words.&#8221;</p>

<p>An aged and repellent Jew came into sight. He raised
Madame Foa&#8217;s hand to his odious lips and kissed it, and
Audrey wondered how Madame Foa could tolerate the
formality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Monsieur Xavier?&#8221;</p>

<p>Xavier shrugged his round shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not say,&#8221; said he, in a hoarse voice to the company,
&#8220;do not say that I have not done my best on this occasion.&#8221;
He lifted his eyes heavenward, and as he did so his passing
glance embraced Audrey, and she violently hated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I think we ought to be getting
back to our seats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; cried Madame Foa, &#8220;we are going round with
Dauphin to the artists&#8217; room. You do not come with us,
Madame Moncreiff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your place ...&#8221; muttered Xavier discouragingly,
with a look at Dauphin, and another shrug of the shoulders.
&#8220;I have been ...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Dauphin, in a strange new tone. And then
very brightly to Audrey: &#8220;Now, as to Saturday, dear
lady&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Xavier engaged in private converse with Foa, and his
demeanour to Foa was extremely deferential, whereas he
almost ignored the Oriental critic. And Audrey puzzled her
head once again to discover why the Foas should exert such
influence upon the fate of music in Paris. The enigma was
only one among many.</p>




<hr class="newChapter" />
<h2><a name="chapter_44" id="chapter_44" />CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

<h3>END OF THE CONCERT</h3>


<p>The first item after the true interval was the Chaconne of
Bach, which Musa had played upon a memorable occasion
in Frinton. He stood upon the platform utterly alone,
against a background of empty chairs, double-basses and
drums. He seemed to be unfriended and forlorn. It
appeared to Audrey that he was playing with despair. She
wished, as she looked from Musa to the deserted places in
the body of the hall, that the piece was over, and that the
entire concert was over. How could anyone enjoy such
an arid maze of sounds? The whole theory of classical
composition and its vogue was hollow and ridiculous.
People did not like the classics; they could not and they
never would. Now a waltz ... after a jolly dinner and
wine! ... But the Chaconne! But Bach! But culture!
The audience was visibly and audibly restless. For about
two hundred years the attempt to force this Chaconne upon
the public had been continuous, and it was still boring them.
Of course it was! The thing was unnatural.</p>

<p>And she herself was a fool; she was a ninny. And the
alleged power of money was an immense fraud. She had
thought to perform miracles by means of a banking account.
For a moment she had imagined that the miracles had come
to pass. But they had not come to pass. The public was
too old, too tired, and too wary. It could not thus be
tricked into making a reputation. The forces that made
reputations were far less amenable than she had fancied.
The world was too clever and too experienced for her ingenuous
self. Geniuses were not lying about and waiting
to be picked up. Musa was not a genius. She had been a
simpleton, and the sacred Quarter had been a simpleton.
She was rather angry with Musa for not being a genius.
And the confidence which he had displayed a few hours
earlier was just grotesque conceit! And men and women
who were supposed to be friendly human hearts were not
so in truth. They were merely indifferent and callous spectators.
The Foas, for example, were chattering in their
box, apparently oblivious of the tragedy that was enacting
under their eyes. But then, it was perhaps not a tragedy;
it was perhaps a farce.</p>

<p>And what would these self-absorbed spectators of existence
say and do, if and when it was known that she was
no longer a young woman of enormous wealth? Would
Dauphin have sought to compel her to enter his studio had
he been aware that her fortune had gone tip in smoke?
She was not in a real world. She was in a world of shams.
And she was a sham in the world of shams. She wanted
to be back again in the honest realities of Moze, where in
the churchyard she could see the tombs of her great-great-grandfathers.
Only one extraneous interest drew her
thoughts away from Moze. That interest was Mr. Gilman.
Mr. Gilman was her conquest and her slave. She adored
him because he was so wistful and so reliable and so
adoring. Mr. Gilman sat intent and straight upright in
Madame Piriac&#8217;s box and behaved just as though Bach
himself was present. He understood nothing of Bach, but
he could be trusted to behave with benevolence.</p>

<p>The music suddenly ceased. The Chaconne was finished.
The gallery of enthusiasts still applauded with vociferation,
with mystic faith, with sublime obstinacy. It was carrying
on a sort of religious war against the base apathy of the
rest of the audience. It was determined to force its belief
down the throats of the unintelligent mob. It had made
up its mind that until it had had its way the world should
stand still. No encore had yet been obtained, and the
gallery was set on an encore. The clapping fainted, expired,
and then broke into new life, only to expire again
and recommence. A few irritated persons hissed. The
gallery responded with vigour. Musa, having retired, reappeared,
very white, and bowed. The applause was
feverish and unconvincing. Musa vanished. But the
gallery had thick soles and hard hands and stout sticks,
even serviceable umbrellas. It could not be appeased by
bows alone. And after about three minutes of tedious
manoeuvring, Musa had at last to yield an encore that in
fact nobody wanted. He played a foolish pyrotechnical
affair of De Bériot, which resembled nothing so much as a
joke at a funeral. After that the fate of the concert could
not be disputed even by the gallery. At the finish of the
evening there was, in the terrible idiom of the theatre,
&#8220;not a hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether Musa had played well or ill, Audrey had not
the least idea. Nor did that point seem to matter. Naught
but the attitude of the public seemed to matter. This was
strange, because for a year Audrey had been learning steadily
in the Quarter that the attitude of the public had no importance
whatever. She suffered from the delusion that
the public was staring at her and saying to her: &#8220;You, you
silly little thing, are responsible for this fiasco. We condescended
to come&mdash;and this is what you have offered us.
Go home, and let your hair down and shorten your skirts,
for you are no better than a schoolgirl, after all.&#8221; She
was really self-conscious. She despised Musa, or rather
she threw to him a little condescending pity. And yet at
the same time she was furious against that group in the
foyer for being so easily dissuaded from going to see Musa
in the artists&#8217; room.... Rats deserting a sinking ship!...
People, even the nicest, would drop a failure like a
match that was burning out.... Yes, and they would
drop her.... No, they would not, because of Mr. Gilman.
Mr. Gilman was calling-to see her to-morrow. He was
the rock and the cushion. She would send Miss Ingate
out for the afternoon. As the audience hurried eagerly
forth she spoke sharply to Miss Ingate. She was indeed
very rude to Miss Ingate. She was exasperated, and Miss
Ingate happened to be handy.</p>

<p>In the foyer not a trace of the Foa clan nor of Madame
Piriac and her husband, nor of Mr. Gilman! But Tommy
and Nick were there, putting on their cloaks, and with
them, but not helping them, was Mr. Ziegler. The blond
Mr. Ziegler greeted Audrey as though the occasion of their
previous meeting had been a triumph for him. His self-satisfaction,
if ever it had been damaged, was repaired to
perfection. The girls were silent; Miss Ingate was silent;
but Mr. Ziegler was not silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;He played better than I did anticipate,&#8221; said Mr.
Ziegler, lighting a cigarette, after he had nonchalantly
acknowledged the presentation to him of Miss Ingate.
&#8220;But of what use is this French public? None. Even had
he succeeded here it would have meant nothing. Nothing.
In music Paris does not exist. There are six towns in
Germany where success means vorldt-reputation. Not that
he would succeed in Germany. He has not studied in Germany.
And outside Germany there are no schools. However,
we have the intention to impose our culture upon all
European nations, including France. In one year our army
will be here&mdash;in Paris. I should wait for that, but probably
I shall be called up. In any case, I shall be present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whatever do you mean?&#8221; cried Miss Ingate,
aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I mean? I mean our army will be here.
All know it in Germany. They know it in Paris! But what
can they do? How can they stop us?... Decadent!...&#8221;
He laughed easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my chocolates!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Thompkins.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve left them in the hall!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, here they are,&#8221; said Nick, handing the box.</p>

<p>To Audrey it seemed to be the identical box that Mr.
Gilman had been carrying. But of course it might not be.
Thousands of chocolate boxes resemble each other exactly.</p>

<p>Carefully ignoring Mr. Ziegler, Audrey remarked to
Tommy with a light-heartedness which she did not feel:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did you think of Jane this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Foley. Nick was taking you to see her, wasn&#8217;t
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Tommy with a bright smile. &#8220;But I
didn&#8217;t go. I went for a motor drive with Mr. Gilman.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short pause. At length Tommy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s got the goods on you at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Audrey sharply questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dauphin. I knew he would. Remember my words.
That portrait will cost you forty thousand francs, not
counting the frame.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the end of the concert.</p>

<h3>STRANGE RESULT OF A QUARREL</h3>


<p>The next afternoon Audrey sat nervous and expectant, but
highly finished, in her drawing-room at the Hôtel du
Danube. Miss Ingate had gone out, pretending to be
quite unaware that she had been sent out. The more detailed
part of Audrey&#8217;s toilette had been accomplished
subsequent to Miss Ingate&#8217;s departure, for Audrey had
been at pains to inform Miss Ingate that she, Audrey, was
even less interested than usual in her appearance that afternoon.
They were close and mutually reliable friends; but
every friendship has its reservations. Elise also was out;
indeed, Miss Ingate had taken her.</p>

<p>Audrey had the weight of all the world on her, and so
long as she was alone she permitted herself to look as
though she had. She had to be wise, not only for Audrey
Moze, but for others. She had to be wise for Musa, whose
failure, though the newspapers all spoke (at about twenty
francs a line) of his overwhelming success, was admittedly
lamentable; and she hated Musa; she confessed that she had
been terribly mistaken in Musa, both as an artist and as a
man; still, he was on her mind. She had to be wise about
her share in the new campaign of Rosamund, which, while
not on her mind, was on her conscience. She had to be
wise about the presumable loss of her fortune; she had
telegraphed to Mr. Foulger early that morning for information,
and an answer was now due. Finally she had to be
wise for Mr. Gilman, whose happiness depended on a tone
of her voice, on a single monosyllable breathed through those
rich lips. She looked forward with interest to being wise
for Mr. Gilman. She felt capable of that. The other
necessary wisdoms troubled her brow. She seemed to be
more full of responsibility and sagacity than any human
being could have been expected to be. She was, however,
very calm. Her calmness was prodigious.</p>

<p>Then the bell rang, and she could hear one of the hotel
attendants open the outer door with his key. Instantly her
calmness, of which she had been so proud, was dashed to
pieces and she had scarcely begun in a hurry to pick the
pieces up and put them together again when the attendant
entered the drawing-room. She was afraid, but she thought
she was happy.</p>

<p>Only it was not Mr. Gilman the attendant announced.
The man said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Nickall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey said to herself that she must get Nick very
quickly away. She was in no humour to talk even to Nick,
and, moreover, she did not want Nick to know that Mr.
Gilman was calling upon her.</p>

<p>Miss Nickall was innocent and sweet. Good nature
radiated from her soft, tired features, and was somehow
also entangled in her fluffy grey hair. She kissed Audrey
with affection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just come to say good-bye, you dear!&#8221; she said,
sitting down and putting her check parasol across her knees.
&#8220;How lovely you look!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye?&#8221; Audrey questioned. &#8220;Do I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to cross for England to-night. I&#8217;ve had my
orders. Rosamund came this morning. What about yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take orders. But I
expect I shall join in, one of these days, when I&#8217;ve had
everything explained to me properly. You see, you and I
haven&#8217;t got the same tastes, Nick. You aren&#8217;t happy
without a martyrdom. I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick smiled gravely and uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very serious this time,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t
Rosamund spoken to you yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s spoken to me. And I&#8217;ve spoken to her. It was
deuce, I should say. Or perhaps my &#8217;vantage. Anyhow,
I&#8217;m not moving just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Nick, &#8220;if you&#8217;re staying in Paris, I
hope you&#8217;ll keep an eye on Musa. He needs it. Tommy&#8217;s
going away. At least I fancy she is. We both went to
see him this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, we&#8217;ve always looked after him. He
was in a terrible state about last night. That&#8217;s really one
reason why I called. Not that I&#8217;d have gone without
kissing you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped. There was another ring at the bell. The
attendant came in with great rapidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lost!&#8221; thought Audrey, disgusted and perturbed.
&#8220;Her being here will spoil everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the attendant handed her a card, and the card bore
the name of Musa. Audrey flushed. Almost instinctively,
without thinking, she passed the card to Nick.</p>

<p>&#8220;My land!&#8221; exclaimed Nick. &#8220;If he sees me here he&#8217;ll
think I&#8217;ve come on purpose to talk about him and pity him,
and he&#8217;ll be just perfectly furious. Can I get out any other
way?&#8221; She glanced interrogatively at the half-open door
of the bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to see him, either!&#8221; Audrey protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You must! He&#8217;ll listen to sense from you,
perhaps. Can I go this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Impelled to act in spite of herself, Audrey took Nick
into the bedroom, and as soon as Musa had been introduced
into the drawing-room she embraced Nick in silence
and escorted her on tiptoe through Miss Ingate&#8217;s bedroom
to the vestibule and waved an adieu. Then she retraced her
steps and made a grand entry into the drawing-room from
her own bedroom. She meant to dispose of Musa immediately.
A meeting between him and Mr. Gilman on her
hearthrug might involve the most horrible complications.</p>

<p>The young man and the young woman shook hands.
But it was the handshaking of bruisers when they enter the
ring, and before the blood starts to flow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please sit down?&#8221; said Audrey. He was
obliged now to obey her, as she had been obliged to obey
him on the previous afternoon in the Rue Cassette.</p>

<p>If Audrey looked as though the whole world was on her
shoulders, Musa&#8217;s face seemed to contradict hers and to say
that the world, far from being on anybody&#8217;s shoulders, had
come to an end. All the expression of the violinist showed
that in his honest conviction a great mundane calamity had
occurred, the calamity of course being that his violin bow
had not caused catgut to vibrate in such a way as to affect
the ears of a particular set of people in a particular manner.
But in addition to this sense of a calamity he was under
the influence of another emotion&mdash;angry resentment. However,
he sat down, holding firmly his hat, gloves, and stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw my agent this morning,&#8221; said he, in a grating
voice, in French. He was pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Audrey. She suddenly guessed what was
coming, and she felt a certain alarm, which nevertheless
was not entirely disagreeable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you pay for that concert, and the future
concerts, without telling me, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paid for the concerts?&#8221; she repeated, rather weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madame. To do so was to make me ridiculous&mdash;not
to the world, but to myself. For I believed all the
time that I had succeeded in gaining the genuine interest
of an agent who was prepared to risk money upon the
proper exploitation of my talent. I worked in that belief.
In spite of your attitude to me I did work. Your antipathy
was bad for me; but I conquered myself, and I worked. I
had confidence in myself. If last night I did not have a
triumph, it was not because I did not work, but because I
had been upset&mdash;and again by you, Madame. Even after
the misfortune of last night I still had confidence, for I
knew that the reasons of my failure were accidental and
temporary. But I now know that I was living in a fool&#8217;s
paradise, which you had kindly created for me. You have
money. Apparently you have too much money. And with
money you possess the arrogance of wealth. You knew that
I had accepted assistance from good friends. And you
thought in your arrogance that you might launch me without
informing me of your intention. You thought it would
amuse you to make a little fairy-tale in real life. It was a
negligent gesture on the part of a rich and idle woman. It
cost you nothing save a few bank-notes, of which you had
so many that it bored you to count them. How amusing to
make a reputation! How charitable to help a starving
player! But you forgot one thing. You forgot my dignity
and my honour. It was nothing to you that you exposed
these to the danger of the most grave affront. It was
nothing to you that I was received just as though I had
been a child, and that for months I was made, without knowing
it, to fulfil the rôle of a conceited jackanapes. When
one is led to have confidence in oneself one is tempted to
adopt a certain tone and to use certain phrases, which may
or may not be justified. I yielded to the temptation. I
was wrong, but I was also victimised. This morning, with
a moment&#8217;s torture under the impertinent tongue of a
rascally impresario, I paid for all the spurious confidence
which I have felt and for all the proud words I have uttered.
I came to-day in order to lay at your feet my thanks for the
unique humiliation which I owe to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mien was undoubtedly splendid. It ought to have
cowed and shamed Audrey. But it did not. She absolutely
refused to acknowledge, even within her own heart, that
she had committed any wrong. On the contrary, she
remembered all the secret sympathy which she had lavished
on Musa, all her very earnest and single-minded desires
for his apotheosis at the hands of the Parisian public;
and his ingratitude positively exasperated her. She was
aroused. But she tried to hide the fact that she was
roused, speaking in a guarded and sardonic voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And did this agent of yours&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash;tell
you that I was paying for the concert&mdash;I mean, the
concerts?&#8221; she demanded with an air of impassivity.
&#8220;He did not give your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; Audrey put in, her body trembling.
&#8220;I am much obliged to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he clearly indicated that money had been paid&mdash;that
he had not paid it himself&mdash;that the enterprise was
not genuine. He permitted himself to sneer until I corrected
him. He then withdrew what he had said and
told me that I had misunderstood. But he was not convincing.
It was too late. And I had not misunderstood.
Far from that, I had understood. At once the truth
traversed my mind like a flash of lightning. It was you
who had paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did you guess that?&#8221; She laughed carelessly,
though she could not keep her foot from shaking
on the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew because I knew!&#8221; cried Musa. &#8220;It explained
all your conduct, your ways of speaking to me, your
attitude of a schoolmistress, everything. How ingenuous
I have been not to perceive it before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Audrey firmly. &#8220;You are wrong. It is
absolutely untrue that I have ever paid a penny, or ever
shall, to any agent on your behalf. Do you hear? Why
should I, indeed! And now what have you to reply?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was aware of not the slightest remorse for this
enormous and unqualified lie. Nay, she held it was not
a lie, because Musa deserved to hear it. Strange logic,
but her logic! And she was much uplifted and enfevered,
and grandly careless of all consequences.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a woman,&#8221; said Musa curtly and obstinately.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, at any rate, is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore I cannot treat you as a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; she said, rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If you were a man I should call you out.&#8221; And
Musa rose also. &#8220;And I should be right. As you are
a woman I have told you the truth, and I can do no
more. I shall not characterise your denial. I have no
taste for recrimination. Besides, in such a game, no man
can be the equal of a woman. But I maintain what I
have said, and I affirm that I know it to be true, and
that there is no excuse for your conduct. And so I
respectfully take leave.&#8221; He moved towards the door and
then stopped. &#8220;There never had been any excuse for
your conduct to me,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It has always been
the conduct of a rich and capricious woman who amused
herself by patronising a poor artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be interested to know,&#8221; she said fiercely,
&#8220;that I am no longer rich. Last night I heard that
my fortune is gone. If I have amused myself, that may
amuse you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does amuse me,&#8221; he retorted grimly and more
loudly. &#8220;I wish that you had never possessed a son.
For then I might have been spared many mournful hours.
All would have been different. Yes! From three days
ago when I saw you walking intimately in the Tuileries
Gardens with the unspeakable Gilman&mdash;right back to last
year when you first, from caprice, did your best to make
me love you&mdash;did it deliberately, so that all the Quarter
could see!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a furious temper Audrey rushed past Musa to the
door, and stood with her back to it, palpitating. She
vaguely recalled a similar movement of hers long ago, and
the slightly comic figure of Mr. Foulger flitted through
her memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall apologise for that! You shall apologise
before you leave this room!&#8221; she exploded. Her chin
was aloft and her mouth remained open. &#8220;I say you
shall apologise for that monstrous untruth!&#8221;</p>

<p>He approached her, uttering not a word. She was
quite ready to kill him. She had no fear of anything
whatever. Not once since his arrival had she given one
thought to the imminent advent of Mr. Gilman.</p>

<p>She said to herself, watching Musa intently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he shall apologise. It is shameful, what he says.
It&#8217;s worse than horrid. I am as strong as he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musa dropped his hat, stick and gloves. The hat,
being English and hard, bounced on the carpet. Then he
put his trembling arms around her waist, and his trembling
lips came nearer and nearer to hers.</p>

<p>She thought, very puzzled:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is happening? This is all wrong. I am furious
with him! I will never speak to him again! What is
he doing? This is all wrong. I must stop it. I&#8217;m saying
nothing to him about my career, and my independence,
and how horrid it is to be the wife of a genius, and all
that.... I must stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she had no volition to stop it.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I fainting?&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>It was upon this scene that Mr. Gilman intruded.
Mr. Gilman looked from one to the other. Perhaps the
thought in his mind was that if they added their ages
together they could not equal his age. Perhaps it was
not. He continued to look from one to the other, and
this needed some ocular effort, for they were as far apart
as two persons in such a situation usually get when they
are surprised. Then he caught sight of the hat, stick and
gloves on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been expecting you for a long time,&#8221; said Audrey,
with that miraculous bland tranquillity of which young
girls alone have the secret when the conventions are
imperilled. &#8220;I was just going to order tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gilman hesitated and then replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;How kind of you! But please don&#8217;t order tea for
me. The&mdash;er&mdash;fact is, I have been unexpectedly called
away, and I only called to explain that&mdash;er&mdash;I could not
call.&#8221; After all, he was a man of some experience.</p>

<p>She let him go. His demeanour to Musa, like Musa&#8217;s
to him, was a marvel of high courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Musa,&#8221; said Audrey, with an intimidated, defiant, proud
smile, when the door had shut on Mr. Gilman, &#8220;I am
still frightfully angry with you. If we stay here I shall
suffocate. Let us go out for a walk. Besides, other
people might call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simultaneously there was another ring. It was a cable.
She read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold Zacatecas at an average of six and a quarter
dollars three weeks ago. Wrote you at length to Wimereux.
Writing again as to new investments.</p>

<p class="letterSignature">&#8220;FOULGER.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This comes of having no fixed address,&#8221; she said,
throwing the blue cablegram carelessly down in front of
Musa. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite ruined, after all. But I might have
known&mdash;with Mr. Foulger.&#8221; Then she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she stopped him. &#8220;So you needn&#8217;t
start on that line. You are brilliant at figures. At least
I long since suspected you were. How much is one hundred
and eighty thousand times six and a quarter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his brilliance, it took two pencils, two
heads, and one piece of paper to solve the problem. They
were not quite certain, but the answer seemed to be
£225,000 in English money.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot starve,&#8221; said Audrey, and then paused....
&#8220;Musa, are we friends? We shall quarrel horribly.
Do you know, I never knew that proposals of marriage
were made like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not told you one thing,&#8221; said Musa. &#8220;I am
going to play in Germany, instead of further concerts in
Paris. It is arranged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in Germany,&#8221; she pleaded, thinking of Ziegler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in Germany,&#8221; said Musa masterfully. &#8220;I have
a reputation to make. It is the agent who has suggested
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the concerts in London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are English. I wish not to wound you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Audrey stood up again, she had to look at the
floor in order to make sure that it was there. Once
she had tasted absinthe. She had had to take the same
precaution then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! I entreat thee!&#8221; said Musa suddenly, just
as, all arrayed in her finery, she was opening the door
for the walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her, and with his lips almost on hers he
murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt not go out without avowing. And if thou
art angry&mdash;well, I adore thy anger. The concerts were ...
thy enterprise? I guessed well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she replied like a shot, &#8220;you weren&#8217;t sure,
although you pretended you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Rue de Rivoli, and in the resplendent Champs
Elysées they passed column after column of entertainment
posters. But the name of Musa had been mysteriously
removed from all of them.</p>

<h3>AN EPILOGUE</h3>


<p>Audrey was walking along Piccadilly when she overtook
Miss Ingate, who had been arrested by a shop window,
the window of one of the shops recently included in the
vast edifice of the Hotel Majestic.</p>

<p>Miss Ingate gave a little squeal of surprise. The two
kissed very heartily in the street, which was full of spring
and of the posters of evening papers bearing melodramatic
tidings of the latest nocturnal development of the terrible
suffragette campaign.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said eleven, Audrey. It isn&#8217;t eleven yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m behind time. I meant to be all spruced
up and receive you in state at the hotel. But the boat
was three hours late at Harwich. I jumped into a cab
at Liverpool Street, but I got out at Piccadilly Circus
because the streets looked so fine and I felt I really must
walk a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where&#8217;s your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s at Liverpool Street trying to look after the
luggage. He lost some of it at Hamburg. He likes
looking after luggage, so I just left him at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate&#8217;s lower lip dropped at the corners.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a tiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winnie, we haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you go to all his concerts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All. I heard all his practising, and I sat in the
stalls at all his concerts. Quite contrary to my principles,
of course. But, Winnie, it&#8217;s very queer, I <em>wanted</em> to
do it. So naturally I did it. We&#8217;ve never been apart&mdash;until
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not exaggerated, what you&#8217;ve written me
about his success?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. I&#8217;ve been most careful not to exaggerate.
In fact, I&#8217;ve tried to be gloomy. No use, however! It
was a triumph.... And how&#8217;s all this business?&#8221; Audrey
demanded, in a new key, indicating an orange-tinted newspaper
bill that was being flaunted in front of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I believe it&#8217;s dreadful. Of course, you know
Rosamund&#8217;s in prison. But they&#8217;ll have to let her out
soon. Jane Foley&mdash;she still calls herself Foley&mdash;hasn&#8217;t
been caught. And that&#8217;s funny. I doubled my subscription.
We had to, you see. But that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve done. They don&#8217;t
have processions and things now, and barrel organs are
<em>quite</em> out of fashion. What with that, and my rheumatism!...
I used to think I should live to vote myself. I feel
I shan&#8217;t now. So I&#8217;ve gone back into water-colours.
They&#8217;re very soothing, if you let the paper dry after each
wash and don&#8217;t take them seriously.... Now, I&#8217;m a
very common-sense woman, Audrey, as you must have
noticed, and I&#8217;m not subject to fancies. Will you just
look at the girl on the left hand in this window here, and
tell me whether I&#8217;m dreaming or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ingate indicated the shop window which had
arrested her. The establishment was that of a hair
specialist, and the window was mainly occupied by two
girls who sat in arm-chairs with their backs to the glass,
and all their magnificent hair spread out at length over
the backs of the chairs for the inspection of the public;
the implication being that the magnificent hair was due
to the specific of the hair specialist. Passers-by continually
stopped to gaze at the spectacle, but they never stopped
long, because the spectacle was monotonous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about her?&#8221; said Audrey, staring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it Lady Southminster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; Audrey&#8217;s mind went back to the
Channel packet and the rain squall and the scenes on the
Paris train. &#8220;So it is! Whatever can have happened to
her? Let&#8217;s go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in they went, Audrey leading, and demanding at
once a bottle of the specific; Audrey had scarcely spoken
when the left-hand girl in the window, who, of course,
from her vantage had a full view of the shop, screamed
lightly and jumped down from the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give me away!&#8221; she whispered appealingly in
Audrey&#8217;s ear. The next moment, not heeding the excitement
of the shop manager, she had drawn Audrey and
Miss Ingate through another door which led into the
entrance-hall of the Majestic Hotel. The shop was thus
contrived to catch two publics at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they knew I was Lady Southminster in there,&#8221;
said Lady Southminster in a feverish murmur&mdash;she seemed
not averse to the sensation caused by her hair in the
twilight of the hotel&mdash;&#8220;I expect I should lose my place,
and I don&#8217;t want to lose it. <em>He&#8217;ll</em> be coming by presently,
and he&#8217;ll see me, and it&#8217;ll be a lesson to him. We&#8217;re
always together. Race meetings, dances, golf, restaurants,
bridge. Twenty-four hours every day. He won&#8217;t lose
sight of me. He&#8217;s that fond of me, you know. I couldn&#8217;t
stand it. I&#8217;d as lief be in prison&mdash;only I&#8217;m that fond of
him, you know. But I was so homesick, and I felt if I
didn&#8217;t have a change I should burst. This is Constantinopoulos&#8217;s
old shop, you know, where I used to make
cigarettes in the window. He&#8217;s dead, Constantinopoulos is.
I don&#8217;t know what <em>he&#8217;d</em> have said to hair restorers. I
asked for the place, and I showed &#8217;em my hair, and I
got it. And me sitting there&mdash;it&#8217;s quite like old times.
Only before, you know, I used to have my face to the
street. I don&#8217;t know which I like best. But, anyhow,
you can see my profile from the side window. And <em>he</em>
will. He always looks at that sort of thing. He&#8217;ll be
furious. But it will do him no end of good. Well,
good-bye. But come back in and buy a bottle, or I shall
be let in for a shindy. In fact, you might buy two
bottles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s love!&#8221; said Audrey when the transaction
was over and they were in the entrance-hall again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;That&#8217;s marriage. And don&#8217;t
you forget it.... Hallo, Tommy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not let Mr. Gilman hear me called
Tommy in this hotel,&#8221; laughed Miss Thompkins, who was
attired with an unusual richness, as she advanced towards
Miss Ingate and Audrey. &#8220;And what are you doing
here?&#8221; she questioned Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m staying here,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve only just
arrived. I&#8217;m advance agent for my husband. How are
you? And what are <em>you</em> doing here? I thought you hated
London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came the day before yesterday,&#8221; Tommy replied.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m very fit. You see, Mr. Gilman preferred us
to be married in London. And I&#8217;d no objection. So
here I am. The wedding&#8217;s to-morrow. You aren&#8217;t very
startled, are you? Had you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Audrey, &#8220;not what you&#8217;d call &#8216;heard.&#8217;
But I&#8217;d a sort of a kind of a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come right over here, young woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to get my number.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come right over here right now,&#8221; Tommy insisted.
And in another corner of the entrance-hall she
spoke thus, and there was both seriousness and fun in
her voice: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you run away with the idea that I&#8217;m
taking your leavings, young woman. Because I&#8217;m not.
We all knew you&#8217;d lost your head about Musa, and it
was quite right of you. But you never had a chance
with Ernest, though you thought you had, after I&#8217;d met
him. Admit I&#8217;m much better suited for him than you&#8217;d
have been. I&#8217;d only one difficulty, and that was the nice
boy Price, who wanted to drown himself for my beautiful
freckled face. That&#8217;s all. Now you can go and get your
number.&#8221;</p>

<p>The incident might not have ended there had not
Madame Piriac appeared in the entrance-hall out of the
interior of the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;He exacted my coming,&#8221; said Madame Piriac privately
to Audrey. &#8220;You know how he is strange. He asks for
a quiet wedding, but at the same time it must be all that
is most correct. There are things, he says, which demand
a woman.... I know four times nothing of the English
etiquette. I have abandoned my husband. And here I
am. <em>Voilà</em>! Listen. She has great skill with him, <em>cette
Tommy</em>. Nevertheless, I have the intention to counsel her
about her complexion. Impossible to keep any man with a
complexion like hers!&#8221;</p>

<p>They saw Mr. Gilman himself enter the hotel. He
was very nervous and very important. As soon as he
caught sight of Miss Thompkins he said to the door-keeper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell my chauffeur to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was punctiliously attentive to Miss Thompkins, and
held her hand for two seconds after he had practically
finished with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready, dear?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry
to hear that my liver is all wrong again. I knew it was
because I slept so heavily.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words were distinctly heard by Audrey herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll slip upstairs now,&#8221; she murmured to
Madame Piriac. And vanished, before Mr. Gilman had
observed her presence.</p>

<p>She thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;How he has aged!&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely ten minutes later, when Audrey was upstairs
in her sitting-room, waiting idly for the luggage and her
husband to arrive, and thinking upon the case of Lady
Southminster, the telephone bell rang out startlingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shinner to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shinner? Oh! Mr. Shinner. Send him up,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Mr. Shinner was the concert agent with connections
in Paris whom Audrey had first consulted in the
enterprise of launching Musa upon the French public. He
was a large, dark man, black moustached and bearded,
with heavy limbs and features, and an opaque, pimpled
skin. In spite of these characteristics, he entered the
room soft-footed as a fairy, ingratiating as a dog aware
of his own iniquity, reassuring as applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Shinner. But how did you know we were
here? As a matter of fact we aren&#8217;t here. My husband
has not arrived yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Mr. Shinner, &#8220;I happened to hear that
you had telegraphed for rooms, and as I was in the neighbourhood
I thought I would venture to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who told you we had telegraphed for rooms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The manager is a good friend of mine, and as you
are now famous&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Ah! I have heard all about the German
tour. I mean I have read about it. I subscribe to the
German musical papers. One must, in my profession. Also
I have had direct news from my correspondents in Germany.
It was a triumph there, was it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;After Dusseldorf. My husband
did not make much money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will not trouble you,&#8221; Mr. Shinner smiled easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But somebody did&mdash;the agents did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not so much as you think, madam, if I may
say so. Perhaps not so much as you think. And we must
all live&mdash;unfortunately. Has your husband made any
arrangements yet for London or for a provincial tour? I
have reason to think that the season will be particularly
brilliant. And I can now offer advantages&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Shinner, when I last saw you, and it isn&#8217;t
so very long ago, you told me that my husband was not a
concert-player, which was exactly what I had heard in
Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go quite so far as that, surely, did I?&#8221; Mr.
Shinner softly insinuated. He might have been pouring
honey from his mouth. &#8220;Surely I didn&#8217;t say quite that?
And perhaps I had been too much influenced by Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you said he wasn&#8217;t a concert-player and never
would be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rub it in, madam,&#8221; said Mr. Shinner merrily.
&#8221;<em>Peccavi</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing, madam,&#8221; he disclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you said there were far too many violinists on the
market, and that it was useless for a French player to offer
himself to the London musical public. And I don&#8217;t know
what you didn&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know then that your husband would have
such a success in Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What difference does that make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Mr. Shinner, &#8220;it makes every difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But England and Germany hate each other. At least
they despise each other. And what&#8217;s more, nearly everybody
in Germany was talking about going to war this
summer. I was told they are all ready to invade England
after they have taken Paris and Calais. We heard it
everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about any war,&#8221; said Mr.
Shinner with tranquillity. &#8220;But I do know that the London
musical public depends absolutely on Germany. The
only first-class instrumentalist that England has ever produced
had no success here until he went to Germany and
Germanised his name and himself and announced that he
despised England. Then he came back, and he has caused a
furore ever since. So far as regards London, a success in
Karlsruhe, Wiesbaden, Leipzig, Dusseldorf, and so on, is
worth far more than a success in the Queen&#8217;s Hall. Indeed&mdash;can
you get a success in the Queen&#8217;s Hall without a
success in these places first? I doubt it. Your husband
now has London at his feet. Not Paris, though he may
capture Paris after he has captured London. But London
certainly. He cannot find a better agent than myself. All
artists like me, because I <em>understand</em>. You see, my mother
was harpist to the late Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband is assuredly a genius, madam!&#8221; Mr.
Shinner stood up in his enthusiasm, and banged his left fist
with his right palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;But you are such
an expensive luxury.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Shinner pushed away the accusation with both
hands. &#8220;Madam, madam, I shall take all the risks. I
should not dream, now, of asking for a cheque on account.
On the contrary, I should guarantee a percentage of the
gross receipts. Perhaps I am unwise to take risks&mdash;I dare
say I am&mdash;but I could not bear to see your husband in the
hands of another agent. We professional men have our
feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Mr. Shinner,&#8221; said Audrey impulsively. It
was not a proper remark to make, but the sudden impetuous
entrance of Musa himself, carrying his violin case,
eased the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a man which is asking for you outside in the
corridor,&#8221; said Musa to his wife. &#8220;It is the gardener,
Aguilar, I think. I have brought all the luggage, not excluding
that which was lost at Hamburg.&#8221; He had a
glorious air, and was probably more proud of his still
improving English and of his ability as a courier than of
his triumphs on the fiddle. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; Mr. Shinner was
bowing before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Shinner, the agent, my love,&#8221; said Audrey.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you to talk to him. He sees money in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the passage the authentic Aguilar stood with Miss
Ingate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Mr. Aguilar,&#8221; said Miss Ingate. &#8220;I&#8217;m just
going into No. 37, Madame Piriac&#8217;s room. Don&#8217;t you think
Mr. Aguilar looks vehy odd in London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Aguilar. You in town on business?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aguilar touched his forehead. It is possible that he
looked very odd in London, but he was wearing a most
respectable new suit of clothes, and might well have passed
for a land agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Mornin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am. I had to come up because I couldn&#8217;t
get delivery of those wallpapers you chose. Otherwise all
the repairs and alterations are going on as well as could
be expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how is your wife, Aguilar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s nicely, thank ye, ma&#8217;am. I pointed out to the
foreman that it would be a mistake to make the dining-room
door open the other way, as the architect suggested.
But he would do it. However, I&#8217;ve told you, ma&#8217;am. It&#8217;ll
only have to be altered back. Perhaps I ought to tell you
that I took the liberty of taking a fortnight&#8217;s holiday,
ma&#8217;am. It&#8217;s the only holiday I ever did take, except the
annual day off for the Colchester Rose Show, which is
perhaps more a matter of business with a head gardener
than a holiday, as ye might say. My wife wanted me in
London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not caught yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m. And I don&#8217;t think as she will be, not with me
about. I never did allow myself to be bossed by police, and
I always been too much for &#8217;em. And as I&#8217;m on the
matter, ma&#8217;am, I should like to give you notice as soon
as it&#8217;s convenient. I wouldn&#8217;t leave on any account till that
foreman&#8217;s off the place; he&#8217;s no better than a fool. But as
soon afterwards as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Aguilar. I was quite expecting it. Where
are you going to live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ve got hold of a little poultry run
business in the north of London. It&#8217;ll be handy for Holloway
in case&mdash;And Jane asked me to give you this letter,
ma&#8217;am. I see her this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Audrey read the note. Very short, it was signed
&#8220;Jane&#8221; and &#8220;Nick,&#8221; and dated from a house in Fitzroy
Street. It caused acute excitement in Audrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall come at once,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Getting rid of Aguilar, she knocked at the door of
No. 37.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read that,&#8221; she ordered Miss Ingate and Madame
Piriac, giving them the note jointly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you going?&#8221; said Miss Ingate, nervous and
impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Audrey answered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t they ask me
to go at once? I meant to write to my cousins at Woodbridge
and my uncles in the colonies, and tell them all that
I was settling down at last. And I meant to look at those
new flats in Park Lane with Musa. But I shall have to
leave all that for the present. Also my lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, darling,&#8221; put in Madame Piriac, who had been
standing before the dressing-table trying on a hat. &#8220;But,
darling, it is very serious, this matter. What about your
husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll keep,&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;He&#8217;s had his turn. I
must have mine now. I haven&#8217;t had a day off from being
a wife for ever so long. And it&#8217;s a little enervating, you
know. It spoils you for the fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagined to myself that you two were happy in an
ideal fashion,&#8221; murmured Madame Piriac.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are!&#8221; said Audrey. &#8220;Though a certain coolness
did arise over the luggage this morning. But I don&#8217;t
want to be ideally happy all the time. And I won&#8217;t be. I
want&mdash;I want all the sensations there are; and I want to
be everything. And I can be. Musa understands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does,&#8221; said Miss Ingate, &#8220;he&#8217;ll be the first
husband that ever did.&#8221; Her lips were sardonic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course,&#8221; said Audrey nonchalantly, &#8220;he <em>is</em>.
Didn&#8217;t you know that?... And didn&#8217;t you tell me not
to forget Lady Southminster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; said Miss Ingate.</p>

<p>Audrey heard voices in the corridor. Musa was parting
from a subservient Shinner. Also the luggage was bumping
along the carpet. She called her husband into No. 37
and kissed him rather violently in front of Madame Piriac
and Miss Ingate, and showed him the note. Then she
whispered to him, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re whispering?&#8221; Miss Ingate archly
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I was only asking him to come and help
me to open my big trunk. I want something out of it.
Au revoir, you two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of it all, Madame Piriac?&#8221; Miss
Ingate inquired when the pair were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All the sensations there are!&#8217; &#8216;Everything!&#8217;&#8221;
Madame Piriac repeated Audrey&#8217;s phrases. &#8220;One is forced
to conclude that she has an appetite for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Ingate, &#8220;she wants the lion&#8217;s share of
it, that&#8217;s what she wants. No mistake. But of course she&#8217;s
young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was never young like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither was I! Neither was I!&#8221; Miss Ingate asseverated.
&#8220;But something vehy, vehy strange has come over
the world, if you ask me.&#8221;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
